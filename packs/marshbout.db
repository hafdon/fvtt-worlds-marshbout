{"name":"Jean Luc","permission":{"default":0,"r4bmbG4VWpj9A47k":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2>Rictus</h2>\n<p>There exists a loose concept of 'honor amongst thieves' among the guilds of Marshabout [and Kriobolis], mainly limited to not involving the law in thieves' disputes (e.g. alerting the police so they will arrest your rivals) and things like poaching contracts or violating a parley. When a leader determines a member has violated these norms they [alert] the Rictus, who, rumor has it, [takes these breaches very seriously, so much so that they] carve teeth out and cut the offender's hands and feet off leaving them unable to practice. Jean Luc is reasonably sure that his crimes against the Gaol Madiens fall within the bounds of acceptable tradecraft, but [one can't quite be sure of these things].</p>\n<div dir=\"auto\">As for the Rictus, there are many rumors whispered about why they do what they do. Jean Luc has heard they were once betrayed by a partner, some thieves have suggested that The Rictus just enjoys the challenge of hunting elusive prey, there are those who belive that the Rictus isn't human -- that they are an apparition or golem given form and purpose to punish betrayers.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h1>Gaol Maidens</h1>\n<h2>Falling out</h2>\n<p>Growing increasingly disillusioned by the direction that the Gaol Maidens are heading, Jean Luc is summoned to a meeting to discuss their latest caper.&nbsp; The target is the daughter of a particularly wealthy, but also stubborn, noble, with a reputation for killing intruders on his sprawling estate. The estate is guarded with soldiers and magical wards and so the decision is made to kidnap his daughter during a local parade.&nbsp; Aware that if successful the Gaol Maidens will almost certainly hurt an innocent child before her father might capitulate to paying the ransom, Jean Luc's conscience gets the better of him.&nbsp; Because the plan involves a lot of moving parts, all that's necessary to disrupt it is a small wrench in the gears.&nbsp; So as the Gaol Maidens are getting into position, Jean Luc sets fire to one of the parade wagons, causing mass panic. The noble and his soldiers quickly flee with the target, but the Gaol Maidens quickly figure out who started the fire and thus Jean Luc is forced to flee.</p>\n<p>[As far as his mindset, ] he knows he betrayed the Gaol Maidens he regrets leaving Majorie behind. But he also knows that that kidnapping could not have been allowed to take place and that he thwarted it without involving the authorities or alerting the family (thus inviting reprisal) affords him some measure of a peaceful conscience.&nbsp;</p>\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Yolindar</h2>\n<p>Jean Luc and Yolindar were never involved {s.044}.</p>","_id":"wXxAhqLsq5gARwPL"}
