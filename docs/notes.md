  > Vengeance: Yes, Drav, that's perfect. I know that Ten-Axe always refers to himself in the third person, so you're doing him perfectly.

## ontology

- Ethereal Plane (EP)
  - None of Flick's interactions with the EP indicate it's a source of power. One of them is as a distinct, 3d plane. another way is that it's sort of like dark-matter where it's non-interactive but co-extant with the MP. so if EP can vibrate at the right frequency with different other planes, then it can allow energy to pass from one plane to another. that's a theory.

- "what are the mysteries that excite me about ..."
- what do you think might happen next
- cool thing for character to do
- important people in character's life
- introduce villain early (make players hate them and want to defeat them) 
  - bad guy or main lieutenant
- monty: introduce your villain when players care about something in the world. villain threatens that thing.
  - first 30 minutes of movie: make you care
  - then: tell them thing will be destroyed unless you do something
- spend levels 1-5 on small adventures, easing into world, small victories, resolve small elements of backstory, then introduce big plot and main villain
