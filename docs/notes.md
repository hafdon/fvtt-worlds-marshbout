## people

- Pelageena 
  - Pelageena: I'm trying to conflate the material and ethereal planes in order to siphon off the power. if my sister's inheritance bears the brunt of the destruction, i will not complain.
- Tenaxe
  > Vengeance: Yes, Drav, that's perfect. I know that Ten-Axe always refers to himself in the third person, so you're doing him perfectly.

## ontology

- Ethereal Plane (EP)
  - None of Flick's interactions with the EP indicate it's a source of power. One of them is as a distinct, 3d plane. another way is that it's sort of like dark-matter where it's non-interactive but co-extant with the MP. so if EP can vibrate at the right frequency with different other planes, then it can allow energy to pass from one plane to another. that's a theory. 

# mysteries

- who is the statue of in the entrance hall of vernix manor?
- sandford wall remnants can cause other walls to spring up (why they look "preserved" -- takes better magic to hide that.

## voices

- yanta from 90 day fiance (like ... someone ... on frazier? )

## DM Tips

- Mick: if bad things happen, we should be able to learn what we, or others, did, to cause it, and how to prevent it. 
- "could this NPC be this?" 
- be open to revision
- "what are you interested in?"
- "what are the mysteries that excite me about ..."
- what do you think might happen next
- cool thing for character to do
- important people in character's life
- introduce villain early (make players hate them and want to defeat them) 
  - bad guy or main lieutenant
- monty: introduce your villain when players care about something in the world. villain threatens that thing.
  - first 30 minutes of movie: make you care
  - then: tell them thing will be destroyed unless you do something
- spend levels 1-5 on small adventures, easing into world, small victories, resolve small elements of backstory, then introduce big plot and main villain
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqWl4On2emo
- known threat that they can't get to -- villain
- "write all NPCs with reasonable thought process behind their actions" -- be able to convince players. all villains could become allies. (treat as factions)
rival != villain
- Villain initiates conversation without endangering themselves
  - Dream
  - Simulacrum
  - Project Image
- make sure enounters move story forward
- make up a whole region of the world, and PC is in charge of that ("The Crick")

### monsters should act smarter

- don't clump up (fireball)
- actually read abilities ahead of time and use them
- have an ability to heal (esp. if it's an object/staff - that way i can always not use it if the battle is too hard)
- Flick has to be within 30 feet of target to activate force arrow, so I could have monsters run away and then back towars them, hiding, getting full cover, etc. And ignoring opportunity attacks.

### players are acting smart

- undead can be turned
- 'confusion' spell takes away actions / causes own-goals

### play a villain like a PC with a plan

- how/what would villain do if PCs didn't interfere (this is what Dungeon WOrld recommends)
- "villain is trying to course-correct"
- villain can't have infinite resources
  - have villain level-up during

### act at the top of the world's intelligence

- consequences for actions (killing a witherling unthinkingly is bad; blowing up the fish truck gets you an enemy)
