- Pelageena 
  - Pelageena: I'm trying to conflate the material and ethereal planes in order to siphon off the power. if my sister's inheritance bears the brunt of the destruction, i will not complain.
- Tenaxe
  > Vengeance: Yes, Drav, that's perfect. I know that Ten-Axe always refers to himself in the third person, so you're doing him perfectly.

## ontology

- Ethereal Plane (EP)
  - None of Flick's interactions with the EP indicate it's a source of power. One of them is as a distinct, 3d plane. another way is that it's sort of like dark-matter where it's non-interactive but co-extant with the MP. so if EP can vibrate at the right frequency with different other planes, then it can allow energy to pass from one plane to another. that's a theory.
