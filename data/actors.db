It fights with the ferocity of a bear, though even in its bestial forms, it avoids biting so as to not pass on its curse. Typically, a werebear passes on its lycanthropy only to chosen companions or apprentices, spending the time that follows helping the new lycanthrope accept the curse in order to control it.</p><p>Solitary creatures, werebears act as wardens over their territory, protecting flora and fauna alike from humanoid or monstrous intrusion. Though most werebears are of good alignment, some are every bit as evil as other lycanthropes.</p></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"10\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lycanthropes</span></span> <p>One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"11\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Curse of Lycanthropy</span></span> <p>A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#remove%20curse_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'spells.html', 'PHB', 'remove%20curse_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >remove curse</a> spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.</p><p>A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"12\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Player Characters as Lycanthropes</span></span><p>A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type.

They ride with purpose on powerful steeds.</i></p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Baba Yaga's three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"16\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Varied Origin.</span></span> <p>They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"17\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">One Rises, Two Set.</span></span> <p>The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses' Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality. Bringing all three together could trigger a primal magical event or chronal catastrophe.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"18\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Timeless Nature.</span></span> <p>The horsemen don't age and don't require food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"19\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Baba Yaga's Horsemen in Midgard</span></span><p>The great witch Baba Yaga is a power to be reckoned with in Midgard, always plotting with her daughters, the vila, and seeking to gobble up the vile gnomes whose souls she claims are rightfully hers.

Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.

Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support.

Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat.

Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"124\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trained for Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter.

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind.

A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them.

Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match.

Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">One Rises, Two Set.</span></span> <p>The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses' Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it.

She has many other servants as well, but the horsemen, her dancing hut, and the sorcerer Koshchei the Deathless are three of the greatest.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful neutral","race":"","type":"fey","environment":"","cr":11,"spellLevel":12,"xp":{"value":7200},"source":"ToB","class":{"level":12,"name":""}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["cold","lightning","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["exhaustion","paralyzed","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["celestial","common","custom"],"custom":"Infernal; telepathy 100 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"bqhvDrAC09ZBclKw","sort":1500000,"flags":{},"img":"worlds/marshbout/tokens/tishara.jpg","token":{"flags":{"token-auras":{"aura1":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}}},"name":"Tishara","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/heroes/RangerSwords.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"CHLlTrRcItMhSZ7G","actorLink":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"VkLJUFgcT1FnizuA","name":"Dimension Door","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Varied Origin.</span></span> <p>They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">One Rises, Two Set.</span></span> <p>The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses' Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night).

They ride with purpose on powerful steeds.</i></p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Baba Yaga's three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Varied Origin.</span></span> <p>They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">One Rises, Two Set.</span></span> <p>The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses' Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality. Bringing all three together could trigger a primal magical event or chronal catastrophe.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Timeless Nature.</span></span> <p>The horsemen don't age and don't require food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\" ><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"4\" ><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Baba Yaga's Horsemen in Midgard</span></span><p>The great witch Baba Yaga is a power to be reckoned with in Midgard, always plotting with her daughters, the vila, and seeking to gobble up the vile gnomes whose souls she claims are rightfully hers.

True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs.

They ride with purpose on powerful steeds.</i></p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Baba Yaga's three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Varied Origin.</span></span> <p>They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">One Rises, Two Set.</span></span> <p>The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses' Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality.

She has many other servants as well, but the horsemen, her dancing hut, and the sorcerer Koshchei the Deathless are three of the greatest.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful neutral","race":"","type":"fey","environment":"Any","cr":8,"spellLevel":11,"xp":{"value":3900},"source":"ToB","class":{"level":11,"name":""},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["fire","lightning","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["physical"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["blinded","charmed","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["celestial","common","custom"],"custom":"Infernal; telepathy 100 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","mod":6,"bonus":0,"passive":16},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"bqhvDrAC09ZBclKw","sort":800000,"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"dnd5e.ActorSheet5eNPC"},"tidy5e-sheet":{},"dnd5e":{"remarkableAthlete":true}},"img":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ToB/Baba Yagas Horsemen.webp","token":{"flags":{"token-auras":{"aura1":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"about-face":{"indicatorDisabled":false}},"name":"Little Brother","displayName":30,"img":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ToB/token/Baba%20Yaga's%20Horsemen%20(Red%20Sun).png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"jvj4Q0DSLMimvh2f","actorLink":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"qRhgL9u8sCTTKtvJ","name":"Dimension Door","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"58\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Training and Asceticism</span></span> <p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p><p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p><p>The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p><p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"59\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Monk</span></span> <p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years.

Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p><p>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules.

This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly.

Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does.

In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"8\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skill and Precision</span></span> <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Shady Living</span></span> <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"11\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.
