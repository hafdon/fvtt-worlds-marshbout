They are all treading water under the surface except flick. Ash is swirling over and above, falling onto the surface of the water, and the flames have died out.</p>\n<p data-line=\"32\">At first, Flick smelled smoke, and can see that there was a brief burst of sunlight in the aethereal plane -- almost as if the atmosphere of the plane had been blown away--, and the grey haze is beginning to obscure the runlight again. She takes 2 points of radiant damage as the light shines on her, and a brief stining and burning remains as blisters appear on her flesh, like a 2nd degree sunburn.</p>\n<p data-line=\"34\">Flick's relationship with spirituality / religion. Her foster parents were the equivalent of Xmas and Eastern presbyterians. her schooling was not parochial. She didn't get the sense that there was a \"there there\" when it came to religion. Her sense of the divine is more druidic, like from Gonfalon, Shoemaker Byte, and others. But her parents didn't -- she doesn't worship Silvanus. Her sense of a higher power is going to bottom out in some kind of animation of natural forces rather than a deity with temples. The gods clearly exist, but she doesn't worship them. (Silvanus is a deity in the Forgotten realms, \"Summer Oak Tree\", ) The equivalent of knowing about as much as someone who went to Catholic school but wasn't a catholic at home. Gonfalon would have made knowing about the rituals and what he observed, but it's not in her heart, and she doesn't know a ton. She's not religiously educated. She doesn't have a sense of what the other gods are.</p>\n<p data-line=\"36\">To Jean-Luc, using an incendiary device seems out of character for the Gaol Maidens. Is it Yolindar, or have they changed? He expects them to try to kill him, but this seems out of character. JL is pretty sure this wasn't meant for him; when the GM have killed someone it was a clean assassination -- even teh fact that a bounty was put out for him is weird, and that it is for 10,000gp, stroked his ego at the time, but now that things have exploded, it doesn't quite add up. JL also recognizes that if they wanted to collect the bounty they wouldn't vamporize his body. (\"10,000gp is personal level hatred; this is just business\")</p>\n<p data-line=\"38\">However, the vaporization conclusion -- although those who are in the room look very injured, none of them have disappeared into ash; it was largely from the crates and fabrics. So, a loud bang, almost like a slafh bang or cuppe dgasoline set on fire.</p>\n<p data-line=\"40\">People still have third degree burns, but no one is dead.</p>\n<p data-line=\"42\">JL climbs out of the water to see if there's anyone he can help. Two close to Vengeance's seat took the brunt of the blast; they are unconscious. the other 6 are burned but sitting up. some are crying, or screaming. none have a readily available medical kit. JL approaches one and offers a drink from his bottle. \"here, this will steady your nerves a little\"</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"44\">\n<p data-line=\"44\">Charisma check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"46\">A little dazed and in pain, they ask \"did you bring this upon us?\" JL: i don't think so. The GM wouldn't do this; if it was to collect the bounty, it wouldn't have been a bomb. i don't think this one was about me.</p>\n<p data-line=\"48\">person 1: you may be right; i saw it wasn't under your seat that it exploded. what do you know about that creepy hairless man you brought with you? JL looks at vengeance, who is slowly beginning to suffer from alopecia. the monastery was suppressing his natural testoterone production, which meant his hairloss, such as it would have been, was ameliorated, but in the absence of that adulteration he's beginning to experience male pattern baldness. vengeance: thinks to himself: i'm more like a reverse-sampson, though, in that the more hair i lose the stronger i get. drav looks around to help. of the other people who made it into the water, 3 are healers and attend to the worst hurt. drav puts a comforting hand on one of the other's shoulders. \"Drav is not built to heal\" she apologizes. nevertheless, just acquaintance with Carlos's healing arts (in RUfus's cart) drav manages to do some superficial wound management, using some of her spell components as poultices.</p>\n<p data-line=\"53\">flick, distracted by the weirdness of the sunburn, once the spell wears off, she drops back into the material plane. after a minute. (to everyone else, flick had disappeared) reappearing, it looks like flick's hand was charred from the explosion.</p>\n<p data-line=\"55\">Rosindra, having escaped into the pool, comes up to JL. \"See what I mean, the Gaol Maidens are ruthless and will do anything to execute a bounty. we can't just hit at their HQ hoping it distracts them. we have to strike back everywhere, posted people on every port.\"</p>\n<p data-line=\"57\">JL: i don't disagree with you about the ruthlessness of the GM, but this doesn't feel like them, not that they don't deserve a bloody nose. i think we also need to expand the suspect pool.</p>\n<p data-line=\"59\">Rosindra: we don't have any other enemies in town. as far as I know we're the only game. JL: (no sense that this is a magical device? [arcana check: 17. ] looking around at the cave walls, the pitting is oddly reminiscent of that on the bracers of the burrowlings. )</p>\n<p data-line=\"62\">vengeance: i told you we should have had that armor made. flick: yeah it protected the burrowlings so effectively.</p>\n<p data-line=\"65\">JL insight -- and vengauns (\"venny\") see, in these folk, an attitude like that of when he first participated in a criminal lifestyle. they are almost faking it until they make it. they might not have experienced any deaths of their guild members so far. vengans noticed something similar.</p>\n<p data-line=\"67\">flick is absorbed with her own issues. [charisma saving throw, not late] feels compelled to get out of the ethereal plane ASAP. she has the presence of mind not to pop out on top of someone; once she's in an open space she reaches out and yanks like whipping around a flagpole on a skateboard, and drops to her knees (almost like the planes are rotating in opposite directions.) to an outside observer it's like she emerged from around a corner.</p>\n<p data-line=\"69\">Between a loud flashy explosion, a 10,000gp bounty that traveled farther than it should to a secret meeting location, and a suspicion about these people, he feels like he's being wound up to take out the gaol maidens.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"71\">\n<p data-line=\"71\">14 insight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"73\">That's a possibility. It's also a possibility that whoever did this didn't fully understand the consequences of whatever they were setting up. JL is now significantly distrustful. But he still wants to take out the Gaol Maidens, since they are his enemy. He asks Rosindra if she has any leads on where the Gaol Maidens are.</p>\n<p data-line=\"75\">Rosindra: Of course I do, I wouldn't have asked you to go attack their HQ if I didn't have some kind of plan. I know they are stationed in one of the sandstone coves in the estuary. I can provide you wtih a map with landmarks.</p>\n<p data-line=\"77\">JL: (snidely) I guess I'm lucky that that map didn't get burned up. Rosindra: well i have it on my person and I made it into the water, and it's in this sealed tube ! JL: If you give me the map, I'll make sure they Rosindra: Is it just you four? JL: do you think we'll need more than that. I guess we could leave the monk at home.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"83\">\n<p data-line=\"83\">Performance check. 6. womp womp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"85\">Rosindra seems to be distracted by other things; the trackers said there was a dozen or half a dozen people. JL [sadie was barking] Rosindra: you have until tomorrow evening, when we're expecting the next ships</p>\n<p data-line=\"89\">Flick: I have seen the natural ways you can keep a conflagration in a bottle, and this was not that. I went somewhere where nothing on this plane should be able to touch me , but some kind of terrible heat from that flare found me in the ether. JL: is it possible, flick, that you \"brought the heat\" with you when you ported? Flick: good ... question. and she falls into thought. \"I take my clothes with me, and what I'm carrying. one time i pulled aphelia. JL: it may be worth checking back with the dwarves at the library flick: if i did it just as it was exploding, maybe some of the principle carried the heat with it.</p>\n<p data-line=\"95\">Meanwhile Malenka approaches Flick. She looks at her and Jean-Luc. \"I didn't know that you had an upir with you.\" chhaaaaaaa! Flick: I'm not one of those, mam. Malenka looks at your burns. \"These aren't from the blast, as you can see -- flicks burnsn look like blisters, whereas the others are singed.\" JL looks at Vengeance to see if he caused it in some way. V: On the whole, I've been quite impressed with the show. It's a great way to welcome people. At the monastery, it wasn't a party unless at least 6 people ended up badly burned. and 19 need to be unconscious. we have never reached that number Malenka: Were these search parties, where those you ended up hunting were burned? Vengeance: This would be your average tea party Malenka: Because the tea was so hot? Vengeance and Malenka talk about ligatures and ligation.</p>\n<p data-line=\"106\">Drav inspects the residue on the cave walls. When she was in the Ten-Axe archives, she came across materials illustrating zinc mining. she sees indications of a zinc ore [alloy] with a metal that she's never seen before. it looks like it might have been this material that produced the flame.</p>\n<p data-line=\"110\">JL could probably connect that with the pitting on the bracers. He keeps that to himself. JL: given the danger, i think we should part ways. we'll head to the gaol maidens, you shouold get to a safehouse, and you can contact us after tomorrow night, Rosindra: yes, i'll be able to find you at the majesty's pelt JL: if nothing else, the GMs have shown an unwillingness to engage us in public. Rosindra: Pelaria be with you.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"116\">\n<p data-line=\"116\">Insight check for JL. calc 20</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"118\">It sounds like Rosindra almost catches herself saying that, but keeps going with it anyway.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"120\">\n<p data-line=\"120\">Religion checks, V with adv. Drav 24 (she's been hanging out with Carlos)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"122\">Flick isn't paying attention, and is still trying to puzzle out why Malenka thinks she's a vampire. so she doesn't hear any of this exchange.</p>\n<p data-line=\"124\">When Vengeance hears the name of the goddess Pelaria, it brings to mind an event when he was brought to the Monastery (when he was 200, 100 years ago).</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"126\">\n<p data-line=\"126\">Galen though V was born in the monastery, but he ran away from his parents because he didn't want to fish, and the monastery was the only place that would take him in. He still feels the lack of approval from his father in never having learned to fish well. And his father is dead. Vengeance isn't sure who is an elf and who's a human. maybe there will be a quest to find his real mother. but he's always been told he's a half elf and has pointy ears and he believed it. he was raised by people who weren't his birth parents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"128\">There were plenty of literary magazines in Kriopolis, but none would accept JL's emo poetry. He went to a stem-focused shool, though, -- which is why he's so good at picking locks.</p>\n<p data-line=\"130\">100 years ago when V entered the monastery -- there was a , by that time old man, who went by the name of Ienezer. There was a big kurfuffle the day he left the monastery, declaring that he was a believer in Pelaria, and that he would do all he could to spread her gospel, and that he was renouncing the monks and their way of life forever, particularly their asceticism, and wanted to aim for a big city.</p>\n<p data-line=\"132\">Drav knows Pelaria as an urban diety; counterposed to the pastoral and the field. she stands for civil justice and virtue and morality. in these latter years, her followers can come across as hippocrites because of a Judge Dredd situation. Her followers have a strong hold on some large urban centers, esp. on the southwest of Ys.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"134\">\n<p data-line=\"134\">Her portfolio involves starbucks, multiuse districting, and gerrymandering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"136\">The districts in her cities look like fizzlecysts. It's called Fizzlecysting here. Drav also somehow has an indepth knowledge of fizzlecysting ? she knows that it's being used in kribopolis to allocate more power to pelaria followers.</p>\n<p data-line=\"138\">Drav knows that the head of the Pelarian religion is Ibon sufla Ibogaine. if Drav talks to Vengeance, she'll recognize an abbreviation of Ibonezer into Ibon.</p>\n<p data-line=\"140\">Flick gets a drum sting for her bomb pun from a dying man. All the Pelaria stuff goes over her head, but she does watch the pantomime between Rosindra , and looks at the suspiciously treasure-map-like map. She feels like they are being played for saps. Something doesn't smell right, and it's not the burning flesh of the people we just met.</p>\n<p data-line=\"142\">Flick: (to JL) I know you want to fuck up the GMs anyway, but we need to do this on our own terms. I wouldn't follow any of the advice we just got from them. JL: I agree 100%, but we may be in \"the enemy of my enemy\" type situation. Flick: Rosindra or someone already tried to kill us and ended up killing more of her own people than us, so ... she and JL are in tinfoil hat territory territory, believing Rosindra has manufactured all of this to wind them up. JL agrees, but believes that it could nevertheless be a good thing. Flick: what objective evidence do we have that they even&nbsp;are&nbsp;the Hat Baskets JL: why do you think they are working for someone else?</p>\n<p data-line=\"149\">Vengeance: I'd really like a verm-inx right about now. Or maybe that can be a fake name for myself?</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"151\">\n<p data-line=\"151\">History checks, Flick gets a nat 20, and V scores high as well</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"153\">Flick and Vengeance both shout out: Vernix! Vernix is the last name of a very wealthy family in the Cressida area; they all of a sudden remembered Alphonse mentioning a Tishara.&nbsp;Tishara Vernix&nbsp;is the heir apparent to the Vernix fortune. If she's involved with the Hat Baskets it's likely that this is a vanity project of hers. This would make sense with it being called the 'Hat Baskets,' with all these twee contrivances -- from the outside they look like thieves activities, but they are the superficial trappings. Like a poorly researched detective novel. This Tishara is not in the meeting, however.</p>\n<p data-line=\"155\">Flick: Something needs shooting, so let's do what we came here to do. JL: I very much want to visit the GM for whatever reason. I need to figure out who they are and what they know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-portal-puzzle\" data-line=\"158\">A portal puzzle</h2>\n<p data-line=\"160\">Rosindra distractedly points them to a tunnel leading out. It's lit by a phosphorescent moss arranged in spirals along the walls. Some bryologist has taken their care with it. A couple hundred feet in, and see a figure blocking the way forward.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"162\">\n<p data-line=\"162\">Perception checks ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"164\">V recognizes this from the&nbsp;Origin of monsters, and Flick from her past, a nearly spherical feline zorbon completely blocking the corridor. It's mostly a ball; they can't see any arms, and there are tiny leathering toes at the bottom, and almost a beaklike mouth sitting just above the crossed ears, which fold down over its bodies.</p>\n<p data-line=\"166\">Flick hails it, and it opens its mouth so that it is coterminous with the corridor walls. Inside they see only darkness.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"168\">\n<p data-line=\"168\">Arcana checks, Drav gets a 23 and the others do very well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"170\">They all know there is a certain trick involved here. Zorbon like this are used to seal off an entranceway. It's particularly fitting for someone who's M.O. is twee chotckies and gadgets. The opening now shows onto the street above.</p>\n<p data-line=\"172\">Flick detects that this is a portal, but not a planar portal. More like misty step in a zorbo. She rolls her eyes at the affectation and steps into it. Flick steps out, into the tunnel, again. She can see ahead of her the backs of Drav, V, and JL looking at the portal.</p>\n<p data-line=\"174\">She runs back up: Ok, that didn't work! JL has heard of similar setups. He walks backwards through the mouth. He disappears and appears again up on the street above. He is visible inside the portal.</p>\n<p data-line=\"177\">Flick: That's why you get the big bucks. JL thinks it's a bit like having your password be password.</p>\n<p data-line=\"180\">They all make their way up to street level. JL: the more I think about it, the less I think anything here has to do with me. I know the GMs are bad news, and it's worse investigating them.</p>\n<p data-line=\"183\">V dives through head first</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"185\">\n<p data-line=\"185\">Athletics check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"187\">He falls from the top of the tunnel onto the floor, taking 5 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall against redundant flagstone forming a path. He tries sticking his arm, then his leg backwards. His then does a somersault, ending up at street level in zorbo drool.</p>\n<p data-line=\"189\">V: I'd always wanted a Zorbo for Monklemass.</p>\n<h2 id=\"midnight-streetwalkers\" data-line=\"191\">To the seacoves</h2>\n<p data-line=\"193\">JL thinks there's no way to explain what they are doing here, given that it's night time. They head north, passing by Melford's forge. There is a series of hills leading past the extant city walls. There's a guard tower which sits next to the riverrine road coming into town. There are no \"walls\" around town, only the ones adjacent to the guardhouses.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"195\">\n<p data-line=\"195\">Stealth checks. Drav gets a 6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"197\">JL stares at everyone for not being stealthy as him, who's spent his life sneaking around warehouses. They're still 1/5 of a mile away from the tower, -- and it doesn't even seem like they are guards, but more town ambassadors. They look like they are townspeople; there are torches in sconces. It's a 60-foot stone tower. There are some milling around at ground level, there's a stable for refreshing horses. It's more of a convenience.</p>\n<p data-line=\"199\">JL thinks they need to go another mile north of the guardhouse. The river has established a straight course, bu there are still coves carved out of the sandstone. There are notable, old oak trees -- one of the trees has been carved by lightning and is nude on the right. The map points to coves on the alternate side of the river; it looks to be almost 500 feet across at this point. The river moves fairly swiftly, but bright moonlight illuminates the scene. The water level is 100 feet below.</p>\n<p data-line=\"201\">The map indicates a bridge 3 miles north of the crossing point. The Old Five Clan Road is crossed by a double bridge. A mile north of where they are it's only 300 feet wide.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"203\">\n<p data-line=\"203\">We try to figure out the limits of Flick's gloves of climbing and swimming. The DM will have to look this up later, w/r/t checks made during swimming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"205\">Flick pulls out a bag of crushed, roasted thyme mixed with powdered quartz, whispers Gerd's name, and tosses the contents into the air.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"207\">\n<p data-line=\"207\">For reasons not entirely clear to Flick, Gerd has been manifesting as innocuous versions as things she's afraid of. He looks like a Kawaii peryton, with big anime eyes the size of a halfling, a fly speed of 60 feet and a strength of 18.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"209\">Flick greets Gerd politely and asks her to drop them on the opposite bank, above the visible lights. Gerd is looking a little more scaly or reptilian than a purely peryton-anime appearance. Flick ruminates that she doesn't understand Gerd's 'deal' very well.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"211\">\n<p data-line=\"211\">An intelligence check confirms this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"213\">Gerd flies each of them across the river, taking just over a minute or two for each one, depositing Flick first. That side is more devoid of vegeation; there is scurb where the hills meet the river, and she can see the expanse of the sand flats reflecting moonlight, some areas sparkling. It's possible to see large quarries opened up further north and farther down the coast, with the occasional mind entrance closer.</p>\n<p data-line=\"215\">[2:00]</p>\n<p data-line=\"217\">Flick tries to spot any odd assortments of artificial light complementing the soft, pulsing orange glow being emitted from the cove.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"219\">\n<p data-line=\"219\">The DM realizes at this point that, if the cave was visibly glowing from the opposite bank, then he should not have imposed darkness rules on those entering the cave; although, as it would only affect a single perception check, he doesn't feel too bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"221\">Drav was able to learn about the sea cove formations while in the Ten-Axe archives. There are a few primary adits into the zinc mines. There's one mine entrance which probably leads down to this specific cove, but she can't be sure that they connect, as alot of the zinc is towards the top of the hills and the mines are relatively shallow. Drav is pretty sure they will have to belay or otherwise drop down to the level of the coves. Even dwarven survival checks would be difficult in the mines.</p>\n<p data-line=\"223\">Flick: I was hoping to encounter a stronghold, so this is a little more decentralized than I would have liked.</p>\n<p data-line=\"225\">JL walks back and forth along the shore to triangulate the horizontal position of the cove. It's not the approach he would love to take, but with the element of surprise it's not a terrible idea.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"227\">\n<p data-line=\"227\">A group survival check later ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"229\">Drav, smashing her strong fists together, works with the nimblefooted flick to pinpoint the position. By climbing down another 50 or 60 feet they could access the coves. Flick produces her rope of climbing, which knots itself up and drops down.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"231\">\n<p data-line=\"231\">Flick makes an arcana check kh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"233\">While Flick tries to recollect the code word, the rope begins to rise into the air. She gives it play; once the rope is fully taught she looks up at the end of the rope, wondering if something has appeared there.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"235\">\n<p data-line=\"235\">A perception check with advantage later ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"237\">Flick thinks she notices a circular disturbance in the star field; almost like looking at the stars through a semi-opaque filter ('through a glass darkly').</p>\n<p data-line=\"239\">Flick: Does anyone else see this?</p>\n<p data-line=\"239\">JL: This is not my wheelhouse.</p>\n<p data-line=\"239\">Vengeance is distracted by the BDS&amp;M potential of the rope.</p>\n<p data-line=\"239\">Drav recognizes this as the spell Rope Trick encoded into the rope. It doesn't look 'activated' yet.</p>\n<p data-line=\"244\">Flick: Drav what was the last word I said before it started doing that Drav: ... 'dangit' ??</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"247\">\n<p data-line=\"247\">Drav is happy to help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"249\">Vengeance: (pretending to be Drav): 'I'm not your secretary, Flick'</p>\n<p data-line=\"251\">Flick 'cancels' the spell without using it, and the rope assumes its orientation hanging down to the caves. Climbing down the rope, the cove opens out into a mouth, and she can see gently pulsing light far ahead of her in the cove, almost in the rhythm of breathing or a heart beating. Flick puts her back up against the wall and tugs the rope to let them know she's arrived.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"253\">\n<p data-line=\"253\">A stealth check ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"255\">Flick is silent as a clam as she attains the surface.&nbsp;JL follows as Flick adopts a forward position and nocks and arrow. With Flick as a beachhead, they are all able to alight silently. Vengeance tries to fashion his magic weeds into a balaclava for the 'heist.' There is only one eyehole (for both eyes).</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"257\">\n<p data-line=\"257\">V makes a sanity check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"259\">He's unwittingly modelling this mask based on a monster in one of the bestiaries at the monastery (The origin of monsters, bequeathed to the reclusery upon the untimtely death of the reclusive ecclesiastical patron Wengrow Fassiltrim). A kind of cyclops, its single eyehole listed to one side, and its skull, pictured in the bestiary, was decorated with runes and etchings that no one could interpret. He feels his hands recreating the shape of that skull, and then the pure beauty of the coves brings him back to the natural world.</p>\n<p data-line=\"261\">Flick whispers 'wrap it up' to the rope, which unfastens itself, falls and winds itself up into a basketlike spiral over a period of half a minute.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"263\">\n<p data-line=\"263\">This happens at 10 feet per round.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"265\">A fairly regular path leads its way back, winding between granite columns let after the sandstone weathering and eroding around them.</p>\n<p data-line=\"267\">V put far too much material around the ears of his balaclava. The rest of them can hear the sounds of metal and rock emanating from the lit area. It sounds like tinkering or mining. JL approaches stealthily. Flick hangs back.</p>\n<h2 data-line=\"265\">Finally, a fight!</h2>\n<blockquote data-line=\"269\">\n<p data-line=\"269\">JL makes a stealth check. But it's not good enough ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"271\">JL sees, as he's creeping forward towards the light, a glint of metal shoot out from behind one of the columns and slash onto the stone column next to him, releasing an arc of sparks. Flick has kept JL within his dark vision range; too late to warn JL, but she sees the unmistakable figure of another thief or rogue, who's thrust out at JL with a shortsword.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"273\">\n<p data-line=\"273\">DK is very excited to use the Overextended feature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"275\">JL cannot be surprised. The water feature is a melting glacial stream coming down over the sandstone.</p>\n<p data-line=\"277\">JL sees the sword, he takes his dagger and stabs into the exposed armpit, carving out a knot of muscle, and gouts of blood start spouting from under his arm. V: No! It's like attacking someone in a haunted house. Like this is all just a Tashara-Vernix production. She's really good at making things look real! JL: You can't even see me right now! V: I just know you so well that I know how you're going to react. 'Another knee-jerk reaction from Jean-Luc...'</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"282\">\n<p data-line=\"282\">Gerd acts on Flick's initiative but just after her. And you'll notice that Natural Explorer no longer makes reference to a favored terrain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"284\">Flick has her arrow knocked, advances 30 feet, sees this thief outfitted in studded leathers, and aims for center mass. She notices that there's the chance to hit JL because of the positions of the combatants.</p>\n<p data-line=\"286\">JL: Go for it anyway!</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"288\">\n<p data-line=\"288\">24 to hit, for 19 force damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"290\">The thief again manages to twist out of the way of the incoming bolt, taking only a portion of the effect of the force arrow. Flick realigns and tries to sharpshoot.</p>\n<blockquote data-line=\"292\">\n<p data-line=\"292\">13 misses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-line=\"294\">The arrow hits the column, tinking off and deflecting onto the floor. Flick grits her teeth and grimaces.</p>\n<p data-line=\"296\">Gerd rushes up next to Flick. Gerd looks interested in what's happening beyond the corner of the tunnel; Flick thinks for a minute she sees in addition to the pulsing light the shadow of wings beating. Gerd dashes forward to 'put eyes around the corner' to give it line of sight. Not being telepathic, Gerd will have to communicate somehow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<div data-line=\"296\">--- do i have this in the right order?</div>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">venny has to get hawk hatchet boomerang from artificer</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">- could get an artificer of level 4 , who knows or has access to the \"bound weapon\" spell, to infuse magic and permanently bind the weapon to him</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">(good quest idea?)</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">venny stands, and tries to bounce the selfkiller off a column , or a wall ?</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">rube goldberg throw</div>\n<div data-line=\"296\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">the true power of the weapon is to lure other people into using it and killing themselves</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">he gets another attack</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">throws darts (i think he can spend ki points to not attack at disadvantage)</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">he misses so badly that it misses JL too. it joins the pile of self-killer, dart, flick's arrow.&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">the teflon don over here</div>\n<div data-line=\"296\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">JL</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">attempts to stab&nbsp; with both daggers (two-weapon fighting)</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">full length of blade go into him</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">he regrets not calling for help</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">JL attacks again&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">daggers feel great in his hands; he's christened both of them</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">(something that lets him two-weapon fight with the daggers )</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">DK&nbsp; stays near and doesn't risk the OA.</div>\n<div data-line=\"296\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">Scunner: It's those idiot hat baskets! get out here!</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">DK parries one of his thrusts with the shortsword, but still gets sliced&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">- you privileged piece of shit! why do you have to bother some honest to goodness thieves just trying to make a living. go crawl back to your daddy.</div>\n<div data-line=\"296\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">JL is offended that this guy doesn't immediately recognize him.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">flick: we've gotten wrapped up in the vanity project of some affluent ne'er-do-well</div>\n<div data-line=\"296\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">Drav's turn.

They are companioned by one @JournalEntry[NYvtq0Av2tBn3Jkf]{Lum Gorbelly}, an untidy gnoll wearing a white skullcap which party obscures a large scar traversing his face. Flick confesses to a small crush on Thaz, which Lum, a moody fellow, ignores graciously. Travel to Marshbout is short and uninterrupted, except by occasional refrications and anxieties of the parasitic nature of @JournalEntry[bO4QmjSC8NJpkQ4K]{Thubudder Farest}. Just as Joan betrays a worrisome inclination towards fulgurous snorts, fueled by Flick's relentless hot air, the two pass through the stout walls of @JournalEntry[xQbWoi01mQ7CiknS]{Famasta Monastery}, into its homey cobblestoned courtyard, taking a moment to admire the heavy slate roofs and cracked grotesques weighing down the <em>sobor </em>(main monastic building) and set off nicely by the creamy stucco walls and colorful stained glass windows. After perusing a plaque detailing the invention of the <em>metum apmetum</em> (roughly: magic stucco) required to stand up to Marshbout's humid climate, and an artistically unsuccessful, if technically impressive, fresco painted by Laeffarelle Floȝed the Fleam and depicting two (perhaps allegorical) philosophers of indeterminate identity, Flick and Joan proceed to the scriptorium and library. There finding Drav, buried in books but sanguine to continue her worldly adventures, Flick attempts to purloin one of the Doodril Library's tomes but instead is handed a package of missionary pamphlets which Joan stuffs roughly in Drav's haversack.</p>\n<p>The three amigos return post haste to An Sr&aacute;idbhaile, but are interrupted en route by the domain of @JournalEntry[hEOuAoTKDmYsLMKA]{Thuridan}, a firbolg who escaped from the fey wild in order to provide a sanctuary for trollkin. Thuridan divulges that his tiny kingdom has, as of late, been the recipient of certain unwanted intrusions by short-lived '@JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{wavelled} canine' forms; the grumic (clotted) puddles into which the monsters collapse are noxious, avoided by the trollkin, and have to be purified by flame. Ultimately this proves of far less interest than Thuridan's past, of which it becomes known that he is over one-thousand years old and still suffers from scars and trauma inflicted on him as a youth during cultural rites of passage. He mentions a group of druids living north in @JournalEntry[bO4QmjSC8NJpkQ4K]{Farrest} who might know more about the doglike monsters, asks the group to look out for a ggouyl (ghoul) friend of his named @JournalEntry[8fDrgRBtlvDsNSem]{Bathybius} who was last seen in the west marshes, and hands Drav a burvība (leaf containing the text of a spell).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thuridan's <em>uspusta lieta</em> (magic travelling bubble) conveniently disgorges the trio near the gnoll village, where Flick soon admitts that the trail of the @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{hodmandods} has gone cold;&mdash; unlike, however, Carlos's infatuation with a 'gnoll princess' whom he suspects has been captured with ill-intent by gnomes or dwarves. Aiming to impress, Carlos donates his healing prowess to the gnolls still convalescing from that morning's attack. To his dismay, it becomes clear that whatever power hurt the gnolls will require a more profound intervention.</p>\n<p>Ready to move on, but soured on and suspicious of the quest to locate Lupenna, Flick nevertheless leads the group northeast, towards the @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{Grey Tongue} and Castle Karn. The gentlest path approaches an abbey surrounded by hundreds of close-set wooden crosses lolling in the hardscrabble ground. Entering the institution's refectory, Joan discovers a skittering homunculus whispering \"&hellip; they want &hellip;\" into her mind, and the brave adventurers push their way further into the building.</p>\n<section>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"secret\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Transcript</span></section>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">[0] starts in gnoll camp</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">[10] depart the gnoll camp</h1>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Carlos as a cleric might be able to contact deity.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Paros on a mission of intelligence-gathering.

Well, looks like my work here is done. I could really use a trendy fish taco after a hard day's lobstering. He is \"slightly faster than your average bear.\" He wipes some of the slime off his head left there by Kalash, and takes off running for the bay.</p>\n<p>Jaap, wanting to keep the ghouls from getting far, gives Flick the Help action on her next paralysis check, and hops down from the roof of the cart.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap is strong for his weight, and the DM won't title this session after ant biology. Formication reflexes. As Jaap swings down to the flagstones, the vendor insinuates: Hey, would you like some gnoll blood candy? Could really put a pep in your step.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: Oh, woh, what's this. Something new? How much?</p>\n<p>Vendor: just a jot [copper] for half a pound.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The candy is a deep red, and looks a bit like ribbon candy, and Jaap immediately snaps off a piece.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wisdom&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a moment he experiences a vision of his heart beating out of control, and becoming ribbonlike; it feels like a mass of writhing worms; it then feels like it's being torn out of his chest; and then the feeling suddenly ends. He thinks something might have occurred if he weren't so ... wise.</p>\n<p>Jaap: That's good candy! But maybe I won't pass it along; I'm not sure everyone can handle it.</p>\n<p>Flick again fails her CON save, and remains laid out to bake on the roof of the hut. The sounds coming from that direction give her some vague idea that things are under control. But she's frustrated, and feels a bit guilty for leaving fez in a similar situation on the cot in the Temple of Kashtari.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance's confusing story sticks in Gresh's mind, and he remains confused. He's stuck in a mental space being brought back to childhood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg would be very confused too if he'd heard any of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh muttering about Kingdom of Arrenbarth? Queen of Argendarth?</p>\n<p>Haberth can act normally, and actually gets totally out of confusion, and pulls Ogribious behind the trendy fish taco wagon and duck down. They have full cover, and Haberth is unable to Hide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc takes a leisurely stroll up to Gresh in order to smack him real good and knock him unconscious. Pjorg is a looming presence, but not close enough to give JL sneak attack damage. Because JL is jumping up so high to get him on the noggin, he doesn't do the full force he'd usually be capable of.</p>\n<p>Pjorg for sure hits--&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM allows JL to, with a DC 15 DEX check, convert a party member's attack to non-lethal damage against an enemy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg, flanking Gresh, nevertheless does very little damage for some reason. Noone notices anything about this armor, except JL, who knows it usually goes for 1500 gp. It wouldn't fit anyone in the party, though. Pjorg moves after Haberth to get his handaxe back, which actually fell right in the storm sphere. \"Just try and find me now. I'm so graceful on the battlefield as to be invisible.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav 'tazes' Gresh with the Storm Sphere, like a hibatchi-grill dwarf, grilling out types of damage. Pjorg feels the bolt rush past him and, attracted to Gresh's plate armor, sizzles him non-lethally. Her knowledge of arcana allowed her to titrate the lightning and dissipate it into the atmosphere just as he goes unconscious. The last bit is like inverse-smelling-salts and knocks him out.</p>\n<p>Drav then dashes up to the Annoying Pail of Justice, and sees a commoner who's fallen unconscious due to the ghoul poison. JL is wielding his dagger backwards and Pjorg is looking at you hopeful that you'll dispell the storm sphere so he can retrieve his handaxe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ogribious takes one look at everyone and pulls Haberth into the water of the port, where they disappear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick again begins to feel her toes, and when Kalash dies the stench retracts to the immediate surroundings of her body.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap has spent a lot of time with otters, and this water fountain depicts two otters in abstract terms, carved out of the local sandstone, as if leaning against each other, and spouting water past one another. There's a regional landmark called&nbsp;The Pass of the Two Otters, marked by a similar naturally occurring rock formation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: It sounds like there should be a story regarding these two otters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He knows that the pass through the mountains protected Sandford from flooding, but he is also aware that the (rock formation) otters mark a spiritual node in the landscape that transcends the specific bestial power of otters and represents their ability (as mammals) to act as a bulmark against non-mammal marine life, so it's almost like a protective spirit or genius of the humans here. Otters eat muscles and crustaceans and fish, they are kind and take care of one another. They can protect humans from oceanic incursions.</p>\n<p>Would it help against the ghouls? One might have to invoke a latent city power to do that, but Jaap thinks he's not keyed in enough, and might need the literal keys to the city or actually invoke the patron deity or power of the town.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick manages to roll off the canvas of the trolley roof and takes her sweet time walking over to join the rest of the party, being pretty embarrassed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh another customer! Care for --&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick ignores the vendor.</p>\n<p>Typical snotty elf, he grumbles to himself.</p>\n<p>The flames from the food truck have died down, and the proprietor has moved the fish back to the fry vat. Vengeance sits on the edge of the pier with his feet dangling in the water, having turned the remains of his hat into a fishing pole / net, something that's not particularly effective as either, and he's dipping it desultorily into the water, blood streaming from a dozen necrotizing wounds. he attends to his wounds absentmindedly with his hands, and every time he touches one it seems to heal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: That could definitely have gone better.</p>\n<p>They begin to hear the moans and groans of the poisoned commoners. Some are unconscious, but the unaffected ones look fairly frightened and make for the other side of the whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg: And let that be a warning to anyone who will mess with the Hat Baskets!&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He hears most of the people, Hat baskets?! I thought they were an urban legend! as they back up further and start breathing quickly in panic while not ceasing to munch on their shrimp shiskebab and fish tacos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As that happens, from behind Jaap in the direction of the water fountain emerges a woman, big-bellied, wearing a huge decorative sash with a big ole star on it, and has a loud voice, perhaps enhanced with a minor illusion or cantrip. OK, OK LETS GET THIS PLAZA BACK IN ORDER. For the next fifteen minutes any of these vendor's goods are on the city. Come on, let's bring the cheer back.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_3\">Deconstructed fish taco</h2>\n<p>Flick runs over to the trendy fish taco wagon. The vendor there gives her the trendiest taco. There's just a single fish taco being displayed at any given time; it's just a fish scale and then a gelatinous cube (\"essence of ocean\"), and taco-shell/seasoning foam. \"I really hate it when Calyx does this to us; they never pay us for what we end up giving out, and my deconstructed tacos are far more expensive than the others' foods\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: If you can make me a real fish taco, I will pay you twice the asking price for whatever you just handed me</p>\n<p>Vendor: This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a fish taco -- in that it's the true essence of a fish taco. That's a silver.</p>\n<p>Flick: A lot of my money is tied up in bit-gems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: How's the gem-trading market treating you?</p>\n<p>Vendor: Well my foaming machine can break down even a gem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick pulls out a garnet. Vendor: Oh, i feel like the oils of this would go perfectly on one of my deconstructed calimari platters. Would you trade for another fish taco?</p>\n<p>The taco tastes terrible. You can keep the garnet, Flick says, and hurries away. The garnet is bubbling up and turning into lacquered, hard red bubbles.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">Demi-baguette</h2>\n<p>Flick then contemplates eating a goodberry, but they've all turned to dust. She remembers the jam she made from Shoemaker's berries, but without any bread --</p>\n<p>Fresh wholesome bread, free for the next few minutes! she hears. Dreetch at your service!</p>\n<p>Uh, one 'demi-baguette'? Flick requests.</p>\n<p>Certainly, straight from the demi-planes!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ok, let's see how this goes, and she pops a teardropworth of jam on top to make a tartine</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CHA save</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a split second she feels her eyes fogging over, and the material plane looks like the ethereal plane usually does. It's not the EP because she can't see the spookier effects (lifelines?), and then she (there's no gravity in the ethereal plane) jumps and tries not to come down, and it feels like half-gravity (jumping her normal height) but it feels like she's falling at half speed, swallows the piece and the intermediate film washes away.</p>\n<p>Flick also notices that Dreetch's eyes remained multichrome and did not grey out. He looks humanoid, wearing a hat that covers his head and ears, with dark brown eyes and that's what stood out.</p>\n<p>You been in Sandford long? Flick asks</p>\n<p>Yeah spent my whole life here. Dreetch replies. There's some great wheatfields between here and Marshbout; sometimes I get my rarer grains from the [Sjostherne] highlands, which is a bit arid, but they bring in bushels of rarer grains, which you can't even really cultivate on a large scale.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Extra-planar agriculture is not a 'normal' thing, so what happened to Flick is not typical. She might only have been able to feel it because she's a horizon walker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You make it yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh, no, I own the bakery, it's in Sandford, we do a good business with the folk, and I come to this plaza today, and there's one for each day of the week, but a lot of folk come by the bakery as well (against the east shore, between Melford's forge and the Plaza).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Dreetch said it was from the demi-planes, Flick got a hint not just of a wink, but at least self-entertaining, or his own in-joke, and mayyybe a little nefarious.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_5\">Annoying Pail of Justice mk. 2</h2>\n<p>Jaap takes a look at Mormaor Calyx, who's wearing a [color?] sash and a [?] star on her left shoulder. It looks how a small-town Ward Steward might outfit themselves. She's still gladhanding commoners. He also takes a quick look at the Pail.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Annoying Pail of Justice All those who contravene the decided precepts of Justice in the town of Sandford will suffer by inundation by the contents of this Pail.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's about half again as tall as Jaap. He jumps up and looks at the top, which is closed. He knocks once, and a little townmouse pops its head out of the barrel, wiggle its nose around, and retreats back into the barrel. Jaap gets some cracker and drops in a few crumbs.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_6\">Taking Gresh to a warehouse</h2>\n<p>In Sandford, the entire south-east is piers and harbors, so there will be quite a few warehouses, some of which will not be in use.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investigation check to find a place. Established that the size of the pocket dimension in the rope trick has not been explored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jean-Luc wants to carry Gresh around, Weekend at Bernie's style, and dump the dead ghoul into the harbor. Jean-Luc searches his pockets. He finds the brooch (turqoise and iridium) and shows it to Drav.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav casts&nbsp;Identify&nbsp;on the brooch.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then&nbsp;arcana&nbsp;kh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brooches help ghouls from being turned (turn resistance)</p>\n<p>The brooches. Iridium's alchemical symbol is a long rectangle, which is an abstraction of an equal's sign. it's a self-identity sign; it's a non-reactive metal that doesn't oxidize, acting to preserve the shell of this thing.</p>\n<p>Turquoise is also woven into the brooch, and it also has an alchemical symbol: a plus-sign inside a square, means that it resists interactions, like a containment gem, acting to preserve the shell of this thing.</p>\n<p>Inside both of these, is a little kernel of this black stone, which she knows is the same black stone used to make Flick's figurine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: Let's not break this one.</p>\n<p>In this case, Drav thinks that the black stone prevents the ghouls from being turned. Drav isn't quite sure what the shell does, but it keeps something from interacting with the black stone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: We might be able to reverse-engineer something with this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL Investigation. (low)</p>\n<p>JL thinks that the metals would be worth about $150, definitely worth it. He makes a mental note to find a lapidary or a crucible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: We could give it to Fez? maybe he needs something to help him be himself.</p>\n<p>They dump Kalash's body in the harbor. The unpoisoned commoner is too busy eating fish fry and doesn't pay attention to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: Nothin to see here, folks!</p>\n<p>Fish truck vendor: Mmm, smells like old fish! Right up my alley! Like I said, insurance is going to cover all this.</p>\n<p>Flick: You're a gentleman and a scholar.</p>\n<p>Vendor: I wouldn't mind some coin just to forget what I've seen today. (they toss him some gem foam) Who did this even come from?</p>\n<p>JL: Must have fallen out of the sky.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vendor: All kinds of things come out of the&nbsp;Annoying pail of justice. They should call it the Useful Pail of Justice.</p>\n<p>This doesn't fit with Jaap's examination of the Pail. This does give him (mouse) pause for a second.</p>\n<p>The plan is still to get him out of the public square and then rope-trick him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean Luc gets disguise kit to make Gresh look like a drunken friend. The put a \"king slut\" sash on Gresh -- Jaap conjures it? to get advantage on the check.</p>\n<p>Flick: Well, come on, man, let's get you up and into bed; this isn't the first time we've had to do this and it won't be the last.</p>\n<p>Without even really having to sell this, Calyx, continues her business with the people there.</p>\n<p>DM supposes in restrospect that this would all have been quite more conspicuous. Perhaps he does not like consequences.--&gt;</p>\n<p>About 1/8th of a mile away there's an unused warehouse, dust-covered and spider-webbed.</p>\n<p>Jaap heals Flick a bit, and they leave Vengeance fishing off the pier, and he began talking to other fisherpeople and the vendor about a permanent advertisement over his truck.</p>\n<p>Flick tries to assure everything that this is quite unusual for her.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: I heard the hat baskets were busy terrorizing a plaza. Why would they be here?</p>\n<p>No one riffles through the crates in the back, but it's dark enough to be \"lightly obscured\" -- dust motes circle in the light which shines trapezoidal patterns on the ground.</p>\n<p>Flick stands back and lets JL and Pjorg do the intimidating, with Gresh seated directly in a square of light.</p>\n<p>JL: I'll be the reasonable one, and you, Pjorg, threaten to tear him limb from limb.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We all prepare for hilarity as they go to play good cop bad cop with tiny goblin Pjorg as the \"intimidating\" bad cop</p>\n<p>Jaap medicine check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap rubs some gnomish smelling salts&nbsp;(distilled caterpillar urine)&nbsp;under Gresh's nose and hustles back to the main warehouse door so as not to be the first creature he sees and also listen for anyone approaching from outside.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gresh snorts and wakes up. His armor's been unfastened, and knotted to the other side of his armor, and his weapons have been taken. JL is holding the spear and \"neck\"lace. The gem that appeared to be inset into his armor is actually merged with his flesh, so could not have been removed without magic or surgical excision.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav rolls history with stonecutting expertise [20]. Jaap 13 religion (This sort of necrotic damage thing isn't really Jaap's religion.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav remembers when the gnolls were telling the group about their hearts being taken, and told you about a practice, similar to grinding rhino horn for an aphrodesiac, where people believed gnoll hearts were gems that would give them extra powers. It looks like something like this is going on, but the gem&nbsp;is&nbsp;a heart providing a conduit for this necrotic power. Gresh has managed to integrate it with his body. It's definitely an evil kind of magic; someone has either done this to or for him, and it allows him to access powers he wouldn't usually be able to. It's known as a Croid (\"kree\") and it's not all that uncommon, and typically gnolls are subject to predatory attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: I'm starting to think that Joan's former employers might not be entirely on the level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The necklace looks like it's straight-up dark magic, made of larynxes and stuff of dead people. It acts as a single-use indomitable. The heart-gem they can't figure it out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg is in goblin form. JL walks over: \"We definitely got off on the wrong foot, sorry about that. Good news for you is that we don't want you dead. The bad news for you, though, is that I actually don't really care if you do die, so your best interest is to tell us what you and those ghouls were doing.\" Gresh: I feel like I'm back with that weird fish-monk guy. I was just doing typical merchant exchange. What's it to you. (JL glances to Pjorg) Pjorg: Oh, pitiful small one, you should answer this small one's questions lest you have a splitting headache.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidate with advantage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh looks receptive to answering. \"What else do you want to know; it can't have anything to do with all you.\" JL: We have a habit of getting involved in things. Gresh: Mostly we were showing the quality of our goods. I showed them the Zlot, and they were assuring me they could deliver the milk. JL: What were you doing with the milk? Gresh: I'm just the transfer agent, but Snav -- Flick (quietly) Snav! Gresh: -- has plans for the milk. JL: DO you know where we can find him? Gresh: Anybody knows him up in Cressida. I do have to admit, it's not been a great time since he's taken over the organization.</p>\n<p>Flick gathers that Snav (\"Lenny\" to his wife and second husband) did something to Remy. JL: So if we hadn't gotten involved, what would you have done next? Gresh: I have to get that milk up to Cressida. I have a couple wagons on standby. These guys came in by ship; they're going to take away the ingots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL thinks they may have to go back to Cressida.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL Insight. Poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL can't read Gresh all that well. He steps backwards and glances at Pjorg and Drav to see if they want to ask anything. Pjorg pulls out his comically large greataxe and sharpening it with a whetstone. (He's very strong so has no trouble handling it.) Pjorg: \"Oh, is there anything else you'd like to \"volunteer\" ?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidation.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh: Yeah, I'd like Bristlejaws and my necklace back. Any of the foes I've killed who've had beautiful necks...</p>\n<p>Flick stealths over, and Gresh doesn't know she's there. (whispers) \"What's Snav's part in all this?\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidation: Nat 20. Gresh gets a nat 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh: Snav's after qi... qieeze. (not fooling Flick).</p>\n<p>Flick: The metal that you were handing over to the ghouls, what does it do?</p>\n<p>Gresh: Anybody knows what Zlot does, why are you asking me? Flick: Answer my question, fuckwad! (And she charges up a force fist and punches him on the nose) Gresh: Ah, be careful with all this metal! Flick: You definitely don't want me to do that again, right?</p>\n<p>Gresh draws a shape on the warehouse floor in the dust; it's the alchemical symbol for the reddish-gold metal the tiaras were made out of. Drav and Flick remember that, not only did Ecks, the homunculus Domonokos crushed, had this symbol on it, but the door that was keeping Domonkos in his chamber, also had the symbol, which glowed before the door opened and allowed him into the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav knows that the alchemical symbol is associated with linking things together. Flick remembers now that, when she saw, in the EP, the tiaras sending out the threads or filaments into the sky, thinks that maybe it wasn't mind control, but almost linkage in the abstract that she was seeing, rather than puppet strings. But it would still make sense that they would want the tiaras on their head, since they would have felt disconnected from a larger force.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav INT check on the Fountain of Elegance, but she still can't quite remember.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: Gresh, you've been&nbsp;very&nbsp;cooperative. One more question. Are you a middleman?</li>\n<li>Gresh: No, I'm not a middle man, I'm my own agent. I take these commissions as I desire, and Snav's made it easier.</li>\n<li>Flick: Yeah, I'm sure you can quit any time you want.</li>\n<li>Gresh: Exactly.</li>\n<li>Flick: And I'm sure he can't pinpoint your location anywhere in the world using that ... gem he gave you.</li>\n<li>Gresh: Funny you should mention that --</li>\n<li>JL: Don't leave us hanging here.</li>\n<li>Gresh: No, that's all I was going to say.</li>\n<li>Pjorg: The small one here --</li>\n<li>Gresh: Hey, who does this guy think he is, calling&nbsp;me&nbsp;the small one. Why's he hanging around with this huge axe? (Unconscious when Pjorg changed back, Gresh isn't quite making the connection.)</li>\n<li>Pjorg adopts his giant form. \"I'm sorry&nbsp;large one; did you not remember me?\" He picks up his great axe and absentmindedly handles it.</li>\n<li>Gresh: Goddamn, one of these guys. I've come across so many of you in my time, you can't just stick with one form.</li>\n<li>Flick: You think he's a doppleganger, Gresh?</li>\n<li>Gresh: No, but I've seen this sort of magnification of personhood. I've read about it, that's right. I'm a well-read half-orc. Yeah, your stereotypes don't apply to me. I know it goes deeper with this guy; it's about who he is and what makes him confident. I bet something happened to you, didn't it. Something happened while you were small and now you need to be big. Something terrible. Some might say you were probably&nbsp;betrayed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Pjorg is a little shaken by this; he kind of moves his great-axe blade so it's directly next to Gresh's throat. \"Ah, you do have a nice neck.\"</li>\n<li>Gresh: I thought so; you're just another guy who wants a neck-less. See, you're not bigger than me; we're the same.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Pjorg: I don't think that we are.</li>\n<li>Gresh: Alright, you're the one with the great axe.</li>\n<li>Pjorg: The great ass, I know.</li>\n<li>Gresh: I wasn't going to say anything, I didn't think it was my place. But... You've all got great asses, ok?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Pjorg: It's part of the adventurer's toolkit. (To JL): Can I ... separate him?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>JL: I don't have a problem with it.</li>\n<li>Pjorg: Any last words.</li>\n<li>Gresh: Wait, what!</li>\n<li>Pjorg: I'm going to separate your dick.</li>\n<li>Flick: Yeah, I'm not sure we need to kill him.</li>\n<li>Gresh: I'm not evil, I was just carrying out a mission.</li>\n<li>Pjorg: Don't give me this&nbsp;Pseudo-Assassin Creed&nbsp;[or&nbsp;Assassin Pseudo-Creed] rotating bullshit.</li>\n<li>Flick: I'm no longer entirely confident that he was party to the forbidden rune.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Gresh: What rune?</li>\n<li>Flick: This&nbsp;Zlot, do you know what it does? We encountered it with folks wearing it on their heads that placed them under domination. Is that what the ghouls want it for?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Gresh: Oh the&nbsp;Tiara Mafia? That's not mind-control. It's not much better.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Flick: Are they like&nbsp;ThuHborg&nbsp;or some shit?</li>\n<li>Gresh: Who?</li>\n<li>Flick: There's a faction in the&nbsp;Demerast Saga&nbsp;that's some kind of hive mind--</li>\n<li>Gresh: Wait! You read the Demerast Saga. I knew you and I would get along.</li>\n<li>Flick: You know, right at the very end they encounter this group where they all seem to instantly know what happens to every other person.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Gresh: Oh, like the mind flayers.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Flick: Is the Tiara Mafia like them?</li>\n<li>Gresh: Look, if I tell you this, will you let me go? What's it gonna take.</li>\n<li>Pjorg: Fine.</li>\n<li>Gresh: The Tiara Mafia, they allow themselves to be local grounding points for a force from another plane to be able to get to this plane without having to go through the usual planar jumps. Typically if they go through the TM, it's because they've been prevented in other ways from getting here. It's a workaround for a banishment, essentially.</li>\n<li>Flick: So it's a possession?</li>\n<li>Gresh: No, it doesn't take their body. It requires a critical mass, and it allows you to treat those connections like individual synapses. In these small discrete elements they can make it through and avoid that&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Flick: By using this torrent service they can make it through?</li>\n<li>Gresh: It does need to happen all at once, but yes, that's the general idea.</li>\n<li>Flick: You wouldn't happen to know how to get in touch with them? Have you ever had dealings with them, since you're so&nbsp;autonomous.</li>\n<li>Gresh: I see what you're doing, and ... no. Usually the individuals who are conduits are doing so for someone higher in the chain. I don't know who you'd go to.</li>\n<li>Pjorg: I told you an old goliath joke where I say \"Fine\" and then do the other thing! (He slams his axe down on the ground to miss) Haha, I got you with another one!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PERFORMANCE: Pjorg reaches up with the great axe, goes to swing it down, and while sharpening it had cut the binding, and the axehead separates, hits the far wall, slides across the floor awkwardly, and his himself in the knee with the shaft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh: Haha! Boy, I've had this pulled on me before, I sure have.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg's goliath form wears off and he limps away, emotionally devastated. Gresh: Brings me right back. Flick: I know we got off on the wrong foot, but I'm glad we had this talk. (She pats him on the shoulder and whispers): Don't get up too fast. (She walks over and joins the others) Gresh: Hey, how about Bristlejaws, my spear. Can I get that back?</p>\n<p>Flick slides it towards the back of the warehouse. \"Once we've all left feel free to reclaim it. I'm going to keep this necklace, though.\" Gresh: Ok. I'd be careful with it. If you haven't actually killed the people, it can have quite a different effect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fade to commercial.</p>\n</blockquote>"}

Unable to take the great rogue by surprise, it nevertheless shears his head, and great flaps of scalp and hair fall off in ragged piles. Jean-Luc turns around to get a good look at the creature. Though humanoid in general shape and size, it holds its light-brown, almost grainy looking body in an angular pose, almost as though jointed. Snakelike eyes look out from a face full of pointy angles and unharmonious ratios. A high charcoal mohawk adorns its otherwise bare scalp, and its attenuated body is covered only by what looks like a lion's mane, a thick ring of hair around each wrist, and a skirt, though it's unclear whether the latter is made of fabric or dense hair sprouting from its body. All these charcoal tufts appear to waft and swirl like smoke coming off a candle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sleep for a moment longer, it whispers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc ignores the creature's hospitality and, having been unable to recover his equipment from Tishara, leaps with extraordinary courage out of the stall window, landing delicately and racing as fast as he can away from the stables. Surveying the field, his eyes alight on the welcome vision of his companions hustling quickly across the pastures towards him about a third of a furlong away, and he bends his path south to reconvene with them.</p>\n<p>Just as the rest of the party sees him bolt from the general area in which Flick's unerring sense of direction, and the tiny scrap of white cloth he'd hung out the window, led them to expect him to be, his features contort in fear. His lustrous hair, marred by the sheets of scalp flapping against his head, whips around as he looks behind him and a creature pours its roughened, rodlike bodybarts out the window, adopts a balleting pose, and begins to twirl, float, and spring after him, taking on, for a moment, the features of something else entirely -- a creature out of Jean-Luc's living nightmares, an assassin of assassins, the Rictus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick, farsighted, fears for her friend, so much so that she sets two arrows fly at a distance which&nbsp;could possiblymiss, an almost unthinkable concession to the safety of Jean-Luc. Both hit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_5\">Jaap gets nil-bogged down</h2>\n<p>Jaap moves towards Jean-Luc to offer help, but is confronted by Pjorg, his goblinoid features accentuated into those of a nilbog. It introduces itself as Ri, and begins a dance (Ri's Irresistible Dance) to counterpoint that of the sand phantom, which Jaap feels himself unable to resist taking up himself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_6\">Jean-Luc sprints</h2>\n<p>Jean-Luc has the momentary thought that Tishara is doing it for the insurance money!</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_7\">I scratch my back</h2>\n<p>Vengeance is a big fan of Tishara's, and he's heard that her estate is around here, so he walks towards it, but as he does that he takes his severed hand and puts it on the point of his sword so it's like a back scratcher. He uses that to pass over his ghoul wounds and heal them with Healing Hands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You're not going to let JL hog all the speed, are you, Vengeance, Flick taunts.</p>\n<p>No, I want to run up and give JL a slap in the face, because I had a dream last night that he stole an apple turnover from me.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry Dream Jean-Luc stole an apple turnover from you, JL says.</p>\n<p>It was so delicious, Vengeance says, convinced that JL is insincere and mocking him. However, too out of breath, Vengeance stands midway between the two, panting, shaking his backscratcher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_8\">Puppetry of the Pj&ouml;rgness</h2>\n<p>Pjorg, I didn't know you had these cool dance moves! Jaap says encouragingly to the shuffing, twirling, pirouetting goblin (with twisted features and completely different clothing).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The \"weird tweaker's\" legs start to turn separately from its body and its legs start to gallop as it morphs into a kind of centaur. The horse body is sandy in color; its mane and tail are charcoal whisps, and it sheds sand and fog and begins to gallop. Flick definitely gets \"aethereal plane\" ether vibes from its hair and fabrics; it appears as though they are even beginning to be pulled back into the arms of the plane hurricane (hurriplane). It then takes off galloping around the side of the stables.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_9\">Metahippophobia</h2>\n<p>Vengeance, terrified that someone is again beginning to turn people into horses, and thinks the sorceress might be around.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Was MuleEstra ever a person or was your wife always a mule, Flick asks, seeing Vengeance overtaken by&nbsp;metahippophobia&nbsp;(fear of people being changed into equines?).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She was a person, and we were dating, and while we were dating she was turned into a mule, just as I was getting ready to break up with her, and I was like, Oh no, I like her so much better as a mule, and, meanwhile the sorceress left, or went to a different plane, and said, I'll be back, to change her into a human, but I think the mule thinks that I'm trying to get vengeance on her, which is why I'm called Vengeance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_10\">Un-critical</h2>\n<p>Flick uses her Ethereal Steps version of Etherealness. She feels herself drop, easily and heavily, into the EP. She immediately feels the immensity of the hurricane-like planar winds above her. The outlines and solidity of buildings on the material planes become faint, and (ecause this area of the world is mixing the material and ethereal plane, it's possible to see further than 60 feet) she can see the vague outline of the sandman, which looks to be existing in both the material and ethereal plane.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Will she be able to hit it if she shoots at it in the ethereal plane? She dashes into the stable, making sure to stay away from walls and horses's butts. The sandman, she thinks, does not see her. She hits with the first arrow, and Flick hears whispered into her ear \"Well you're not going to be as easy to put to sleep, are you?\" , and the last hits critically, although the arrow looks wobbly and limp, reminding her of when Gonfalon would trick her and put an arrow made of greenwood into the quiver, which wouldn't fly properly, and the creature emits a strange feathering of the twirling charcoal fog; such terrene notions as \"crits\" may not apply to this creature. Flick drops back into the stable, the smell of manure and the sight of a riding horse smacks her in the face. Is this horse suspicious? It seems a little suspicious, but no more than your average raccoon. Flick moves her hand protectively over her snack sack, and the horse's nostrils widen and drink the air.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_11\">Drav's new face</h2>\n<p>Drav recognizes a deific presence inside Pjorg's body, and one that he may not have invited in willingly, although he doesn't seem to be injured apart from the contorsion and almost rubbery caricaturing of his face, and the wardrobe change. Pjorg's eyes are glittering, and the masklike nature of his face calls to mind the mask of Juniper Three School, but, whereas that mask replaced the wearer's face, this one modifies it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg is taking a little break right now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With whom do I have the honor of speaking? asks Drav, deferentially.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm an Aspect of the great Clowngod Garl Glittergold ... I mean, Trickstergod. Sometimes I get the joker's slang wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why have you taken over our friend's body? For what purpose? Drav asks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I didn't want intrepid Jaap running into danger, and Pjorg had all the right openings to allow me to enter his somewhat staid body, and ironically the events here which make what's going on so dangerous also allowed me to penetrate where I might otherwise not have been able to.</p>\n<p>In the sky, right now, hence. He points at the hill. What is it, she asks, I don't see anything.</p>\n<p>He begins to approach Drav, whose grounding in reality is just too strong, and suddenly backs off and says, Oh I'm sorry, it won't work that way. Let me try this. He grabs at the back of his head, pulling forward as the skin ripples and stretches, until, his face torn off, normal-looking, if placid and unfocused, Pjorg is standing there holding a rudimentary mask carved out of blonde maple and bearing two inset turquoise marbles for eyes. With little ceremony he places the mask up to Drav's face, where it adheres, her skin dancing and tingling. She is suddenly able to see the hurricane of ethereal and material matter. He pops the mask back off and puts it back on his own face.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is that what you would like us to avoid? Drav asks. Yes, in a way, I would like Jaap to be circumspect when moving towards that place; this little gnome has quite a ways until he doesn't have to rely on the integrity of his physical form. However, there is a more proximal concern, and that's the scion of this house, who has designs on conflating these two planes with one another.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav plays amplifier for the group and shouts out the information as she learns it. So, where can we find this scion? Ri says, I think she's just inside the manor house, cheering on what, by now, may be an unpreventable local cataclysm. As with most of these things, when the motivation and power comes from a single individual, typically, killing them or incapacitating them in some way. It's not quite clear to me as just an aspect whether she has automated the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Well, then can you release Pjorg and Jaap so that we can get going with this? Uh, you know, Pjorg wasn't really doing much so I didn't think it would be a problem to hijack his body; at the same time I have to maintain my reputation as a clown -- sorry, trickster, so, in other words, yes, not really, I'm here to do what I can to get in your way so you don't go marching in there without forethought. And I admit, I can get carried away at times.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_12\">Garl's looking out</h2>\n<p>Jaap hears all this strobing through the phat beats of the dance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'll try to intercept JL and Vengeance, then, and try to get everyone on the same page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap attempts to pray, essentially, to Garl/Ri, like they are listening, slows down their dance, and says, No, I didn't mean to keep you here dancing forever -- that seems more like a punishment than a jape. You're free -- Now! -- to proceed; you're of such character that I didn't know if I'd be able to dissade you unless I physically interposed myself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How grave, exactly? Jaap asks. If you find the scion by herself, it should be well within your power to incapacitate her and stop the ... event. She's trying to enlist her brethen in the project; if they've joined her in power or sympathies it will get exponentially harder, replies Ri. Like the concert automaton? Jaap asks. Oh, no, that's not hers; I think that's a product of the breakdown between the ethereal and material planes or the dream world and the waking world. I would guess that your rogue friend was still suffering narcotic effects and that allowed a soportropism (sleep - seeking?) to target him.</p>\n<p>It's nice to know my god is looking out for me! Jaap replies, and, able to stop dancing, informs Drav and Vengeance of the situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_13\">Too confusing!</h2>\n<p>I hope that wasn't too&nbsp;confusing!&nbsp;for all of you! Ri says, casting confusion on the trio, but only catching Jaap and Vengeance. To Jaap, unaffected, he says, I didn't think so! Be sure to visit me in the Land of Attar, where I lay my head, he enjoins, just prior to abandoning Pjorg, from whose face the wooden mask drops. The goblin is placid and breathing regularly, but seems unaware of what has just happened.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance, meanwhile, is beset by the belief that the sorceress is here, for a moment, and screams to Mule to hide herself. But once he realizes what's going on, he finds it very concerning, and says to JL, This is extremely worrisome, Jean-Luc, I'm not going to be mad, but I'm going to ask you something, and I need you to tell me the truth, is this Tishara's house?</p>\n<p>I have no idea who or what that is, Jean-Luc replies. But he said something about a scion,&nbsp;and that can only be one person!&nbsp;Vengeance claims erroneously.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc doesn't know why Vengeance is all of a sudden talking about a scion (he was too far away to hear Drav's reports on the subject)--&nbsp;Jean-Luc don't spare my feelings on this!&nbsp;Vengeance warns. Oh... yes, Tishara ... spoiled trust-fund kid who wants wants the Log of Pathytus so she can prove to her mom she can get some inheritance? What's the big deal here? Jean-Luc asks.</p>\n<p>Vengeance falls to his knees weeping. I knew it, Jean-Luc, how could you do this? my dream was to be in one of Tishara's big performances, that's why I was banished from the monastery, I was a fan of hers since the early days, I went to her one-woman shows, I took part in her flash mobs, and she never noticed me and now she goes and kidnaps&nbsp;you?! You knew this was my dream, man. I didn't, Jean-Luc replies, and also she didn't really want me as much as the stupid journal we were supposed to get.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I agree that you are a beautiful stallion, and I understand why she would want you in her stable, but seriously, I feel so betrayed, and honestly I think we have to find her now so I can speak to her in person about this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We weirdly agree on that; maybe not the reasons, though. Jean-Luc says.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You're going to have to do a lot to earn back my trust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'll give it my best shot, Jean-Luc lies, but Vengeance buys it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance at this point believes Jean-Luc to be hiding the aforementioned apple turnover behind his back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_14\">Cougars cannot be besiegers; or, \"Am I gonna have to walk past the horse?\"</h2>\n<p>Jean-Luc asks around for a spare sword or dagger. Jaap replies with the offer of a hand-axe, and Pjorg [Ian] states that he too has a hand-axe; it might be a little big for you, i do require one whole hand to wield it, but if you think such a powerful weapon of war would do any good in your hands you're quite welcome to it I suppose a hah hah hah hah. The hand-axe now, actually, looks large for Pjorg, who is in goblin form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yes, cougars cannot be besiegers he says as he tosses JL the weapon ten feet, falling fifty feet short of Jean-Luc. Pjorg turns elsewhere, believing the transaction to have concluded. JL picks up the hand-axe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick, in the stables, wonders why she's not hearing the slapping of feat likewise in search of the sandman.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance runs full speed towards the \"manor\" entrance. He makes it a good 90 feet without qi points.</p>\n<p>Flick can't even hear really anything going on outside the stables; As she's navigating around the horse she comes around a rucksack with a few liquid-filled vials inside.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She can't see the creature anymore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She can't hear sounds of its movement or passage.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM clarifies the Stables tactical map</p>\n<p>Flick ACROBATICS to leap over the stable door and gets herself all the way out of the stables. She doesn't see the sandman anywhere as she comes out of the building. She lets it go, as she really gave it a piece of her mind. She gets back in line of sight with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>They drop out of Initiative order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: (to JL) that was kind of freaky; i'm glad you're ok.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It ends as they gaze with foreboding on the main estate, and a gong plays on the soundtrack as Vengeane is running at full tilt. Lightning crackles behind one of the windows on the third floor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance shouts \"Wish me luck on my audition, guys!\" He sees a structure that looks remarkably like an outdoor auditorium. It's actually carved into the hill that's directly under the tornado; the benches overlook a platform at the bottom of the hill. And they can see something that looks almost like an altar (or, to Vengeance, a podium)</p>\n<p>Flick: This isn't the first time we interrupted some dark ritual.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: And it won't be the last.</p>"}

He slides carefully down, lowering himself from the edge of the column to where it is safe for him to jump on the rubble below.</div>\n<div>- Drav hangs from the temple floor and jumps down.</div>\n<div>- They can see the far end of the chamber to a set of stairs which proceed further down. Drav [Perception 20] notices that the floor is irregular and uneven. She discerns a kind of intaglio physiognomy, as though a huge face is emerging.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jake: was Xanthu upstairs scary or beautiful? DM: he was utilitarian in appearance.</div>\n<div>- Drav [Arcana 5] is slightly apprehensive that the floor-face might come to life; but, upstairs, Xanthu's face and vitality were synchronic.</div>\n<div>- Carlos drops nimbly into the chamber.&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Amalia Broadbeam</h2>\n<div>- [Perception !25] Amongst the rubble and kobold body parts is a newly made pair of leather boots connected to legs. [Athletics 19] Carlos shoulders away the boulders and crushed and amputated limbs, gradually uncovering the body of an unconscious dwarf. [Intelligence 7] Carlos realizes this is his old friend, Amalia Broadbeam.</div>\n<p>When Carlos would travel to heal communities, they would often travel together. She was a practiced carpenter; they would both build stone and wooden structures, build hospitals, dig wells and irrigation troughs.</p>\n<p>She's not breathing, but she is making small regular motions; her hands tremble slightly and her mouth is moving as if to mumble in dream. Carlos tries Spare the Dying, which has no effect on the dwarf.&nbsp;</p>\n<div>- Suddenly she opens her eyes. Amalia is very confused to be underground; the last thing she remembers is building a shelter for halflings at the mouth of a cave in the Braided Mountains next the Talion Valley.</div>\n<div>- Carlos confirms she isn't injured and reassures her of her safety.</div>\n<div>- Hiero walks over with his shortsword and offers to put her out of her misery.</div>\n<div>- Carlos waves him off and tells Amalia he's a weirdo.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: \"having that little hair on my head would drive me to suicide\"</div>\n<div>- Heiro: \"The only sense in which i'm weird is that I'm your fate if you are not careful.\"</div>\n<div>- Amalia is shocked and bemused that he's invoking the ideas of the Old Gods, and asks where he learned about it.</div>\n<div>- Heiro, \"I spent many years studying under the great elf Horoxicron, who taught me many things, among them, the arcana of the weird dragons of Persipoly.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Oh, -- the dragon notions are different than ours, but they still have Weirds?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: the dragons are actually the ones controlling the gods that once lived in this temple.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: what temple?</div>\n<h2>Rotrude Meletorix</h2>\n<div>- Coming up the stairs at the end of the passageway Hiero sees Rotrude, another elf who was also an ascetic.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- She looks similar to the last time Heiro saw her. Wearing a periwinkle skullcap, beautiful dark blue with vertical white lines cassock, and double-strapped monk boots. However, she's dripping wet. [Intelligence 11] Last he saw Rotrude, she drowned in a lake nearby. THey were out together; he can't quite remember what they were doing. Maybe she got too deep in the lake, or maybe Hiero had tripped and brought her down with you. She was drowned and dead before the monks could revive her.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude approaches Hiero. \"Fine, you got me,\" Hiero reluctantly confirms his identity just as he notices her blood-red eyes.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Rotrude, can it really be you? And look at those contacts!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: On the contrary, i've had contact with very few since ... it was only a few minutes ago that we last saw each other. I came up out of the lake and you were gone. We had been fishing and reminiscing about your parents, Gorenchim and Weldemoet.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: please don't bring them up.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude, yes, it did get quite heated.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Amalia: \"who is that ... and who are the rest of you?\"</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Most are my friends, except for the new one.</div>\n<div>- Fez finishes his seaweed jerky and hears too many people talking below.</div>\n<div>- Carlos, \"Is there any jerky left? Dangit!\"</div>\n<div>- Fez, somewhere deep in his subconscious, begins to contemplate braiding together the grape and seaweed jerky.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Fez drops in</h2>\n<div>- Fez, \"There's a bit of a crowd down here\" [Perception 23].&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav had discovered a secret door in the far corner of the temple floor; Fez sees a chainmail hood off of which glitters chartreuse light emanating from the stairway, as though a body is coming headfirst into the passageway.</div>\n<div>- \"Well if it isn't Fezziwig Hornswoggle. My dearest 20th 1st cousins four times removed.\"</div>\n<div>- Fez, \"Why are you here? family reunions are every five years and we just had one last year\"</div>\n<div>- A short discussion of identity ensues unfruitfully</div>\n<div>- I'm one of the Wortpullers, Laceleaf. (She lives in Torffeton 50 miles west? east? of Cressida, a little halfling town near the Gath Valley and Toofy Lake)</div>\n<div>- Carlos expresses disappointment that Fez has so many relatives.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez Divine Sense: These are all undead (he can't tell about Laceleaf, she's too far away)</div>\n<div>- Fez is uncomfortable with how far away he can sense things.<strong> BUT HE'S NOT SCARED.</strong></div>\n<div>- Carlos: am i getting the heebie jeebies from the elf?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez [Intelligence 15]: her parents, Freetricia and Elbow Wortpuller, were ailing, and she left them home alone; she wanted to go out and carouse with friends and 19th-21st cousins, 61 times removed ?? The town was struck by an unpredictable snowstorm, and they died. Her brother, went out and it was rumored that he was going to bring her back or something worse. This got to you second or third hand.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez says BRAVELY: I think ... our friends ... don't seem to be alive. Currently.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: hey, what are you trying to say??</div>\n<div>- Fez: I agree, this resembles my cousin. But just ... can't you smell it? And Carlos notices the smell.</div>\n<div>- Fez is WIGGED OUT BUT STOIC</div>\n<div>- Rotrude and Laceleaf start walking towards you</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: Fez, I know that you left your parents back home, just to farm without you. That's not a great idea. You should take care of family.</div>\n<div>- Fez: they can take care of themselves.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: that's what i thought, but they need their kids.</div>\n<div>- Fez: sometimes you have to go your own way.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: i'm gonna make sure you get back to your folks.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>The Parent (and Cousin and Friend) Trapped&nbsp;</h2>\n<div>- Xanthu:<strong> I TOLD YOU YOU'D HAVE TO HELP ME</strong>, and the rubble rises to re-form the ceiling/floor&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez is so perceptive that he gets a free action before combat. He activates his heelys&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- by the sea, i'll return you to the depths one way or another, and casts Blessing of the Sea</div>\n<div>- they yell about what \"depth\" means</div>\n<div>- in the conversational commotion, some leeches fall out of Rotrude's ear</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<div>- Fez divine smites Rotrude</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: If only you used your whip as a flog, I might have supplicated myself in punishment before the divine.</div>\n<div>- moderately sexually compelling to Hiero. Only about 300 years old</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Forgive my skepticism, but the last time we saw each other, you were dead, and the real Rotrude only wore one strap on her boots. If i could put you to a test. I'm going to play a tune on the bagpipes, and you play the next note (he plays three notes and hands her the bagpipes)</div>\n<div>- Rotrude can't breathe, so no air goes into the bladder. \"I think it is clogged?\"&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro shakes the instrument, and a ballgag drops out.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I have this extra bootstrap, and you have that extra strap. it angers me that you would call into question my authenticity.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: what were your last words?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: how i felt your parents' life of fishing and religious obligation was sufficient, but i could sense in you a great anger. and then you said \"Die----\" which i assume was the first syllable</div>\n<div>- Heiro: yes, i was going to say \"Dining out with you later \"</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: dining out? you have been captured by the urban civilization that lives outside of our walls.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: what, in the last five minutes?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: spiritual devotion doesn't mean much if you're not tempted to dine out sometimes</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: yes, in the absence of temptation, we submit ourselves to punishment, through which we may demonstrate our commitment to the divine</div>\n<div>- Heiro: so you want a self-flagellation-off?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: yes, and this halfling's whip would do nicely.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Request a whipping</h2>\n<div>- Heiro tries to get Fez to whip him. Fez looks back at Rotrude, who looks interested in how it plays out, and is calming a bit</div>\n<div>Fez: ok, prep yourself.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: why are you so hairy?</div>\n<div>- Heiro: yes, this is evidence i've been living a hard life out here. it's not like it is in the cloisters. as they say, you have to \"grow some hair on your bottom\"</div>\n<div>- Carlos: also ... a tree cast a spell on us</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: probably you just haven't chafed off the hair from walking extensively as you should be doing. in the absence of that, your friend must whip it off you.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: ok, but then you have to whip yourself harder!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: This is our way!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>A simple crown</h2>\n<div>- Laceleaf: to fez: I'm gonna have to make sure you come back with me to take care of your folks. Just lemme put this little circlet on your head (Crown of Madness but reflavored).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro puts it together that this reddish-gold metal matches the description of the metal deposit that the archaeologists were telling you about.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- The crown dissolves over Fez's head.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: I know you're not one for ornamentation, but that crown was gonna help you figure out what to do in life.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm not one for a heavy head.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: It's grief and your subconscious regret that give you a heavy head!</div>\n<div>- Carlos: All this extra hair is heavy enough.</div>\n<div>- Carlos gets in touch with Aul&euml;, who tells him it's ok to kill the undead.</div>\n<div>- Nothing against old people, but we're against the undead.</div>\n<div>- invokes Turn Undead and undead turn to begin running, as the ducttape on Carlos's spiritual hammer shines like burnished silver which expands in a spiral and frightens the undead with holy light.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude brags about how hurt she is and then disappears down the stairs.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Disappear like you always do!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I have always been there for you, Heironymus. I have taught you much of what you know. You were very precocious.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I already knew that! I just enjoyed spending time with your pet lizards. I mean leeches.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I had a pet leech.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: What kind of leech?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I liked catching worms to keep as pets in the ponds outside the cave. I brought back a leech and then minnows ate it.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: have you been traumatized?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I think so?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: yes, Heiro, you were heartbroken when my lizards died until i got replacements for them.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I still have them ?!</div>\n<div>- `&nbsp;&hellip;???`</div>\n<div>- Carlos: hey amalia, you're running away, do you understand what's happening?</div>\n<div>- Amalia: You're emitting some kind of evil energy, and the closer i try to get the more it hurts me.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: All i did was cast a spell that affects undead.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Oh, one of your clerical spells?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Yes ... although I'm not sure it was worth it. But it implies you might be dead.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Yes, I needed help supporting a beam, and you stepped away for a moment, and ... then you pulled me out of this rubble. Do you just want to put distance between us, to break up?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I only cast it as a test</div>\n<div>- Amalia: You're already testing the relationship!</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Well I do see myself as a scientist. Medicine occupies the middle ground between science and religion.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Yes, Aul&euml; was very close-minded about who you could spend time with.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Drav, did you ever kill someone by accident? Why isn't there one of these things for you?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Drav doesn't like letters (see: correspondent)</div>\n<div>- Drav doesn't recall -- it's a little hard to remember things.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>DM: You're all <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">pretty</span> sure you're remembering real things.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: Can we check to see if there's something altering our mental states.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm pretty sure I didn't kill Laceleaf.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I feel really guilty. I don't like it. I want it to be spread around.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm just supposed to feel guilty about abandoning my family.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I definitely killed that lady. But in my defense she was being really annoying in bringing up my parents.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude (from below): Heiro, YOU started that conversation.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: can we address the rock face on the floor?</div>\n<div>- [Drav and Carlos attempt to communicate with Xanthu]</div>\n<div>- XANTHU: these creatures are of your acquaintance. It's difficult even for me to tell what's pulled from your psychic fingerprints and what is \"real\"</div>\n<div>- Drav: Why did you say we would help you? Have these creatures appeared to others?</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: I have used this technique before. But what I referred to was the death of the Queen of the Sun -- i do not need you to be impressed; i don't need the approval of mortals;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: what do you need from us?</div>\n<div>- Drav: Why did you call out to us?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Xanthu's plea</h2>\n<div>- Xanthu: It's what I see as one of the fundamental impediments between you and a deep understanding of yourself. I need you to revitalize the empire that was here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- the kobolds would be useful as sacrifices. they were unable to establish a working relationship with the guardians before angering them.</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: well i can't do anything further until you synthesize these threats [either prove yourselves strong enough here, or &hellip; fail.]</div>\n<div>- Drav: what about me? i don't have anyone to synthesize.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Xanthu: I don't always specifically create these counterparts. There must be something here for you too. Or maybe you're already perfect. (chuckles)</div>\n<div>- Hiero, covered in soot and rubble, attempts to convince Xanthu that he is a rock monster. (Interestingly, he fails to use Xanthu's name: one of the many reasons it could be said that he failed to convince the god.) \"Basement floor! Ooooooh! It is I, Terence, your baby brother, who you allowed to drink mead at 10 years old, and fell off a parapet to my death! Woooooooooooooooooo!\"</div>\n<div>- Terence, is that you! Come towards my eyes so that I may see you!</div>\n<div>- Heiro trips on a rocky outcropping on the floor and goes sprawling into where the mouth concavity was.</div>\n<div>- Drav casts obsidian shards on Laceleaf.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf's eyes burn bright red, \"If I'm gonna hurt, you're gonna hurt too\"</div>\n<div>- Drav gets Hellish-Rebuked. red flames with burning white core.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Carlos, are you just trying to punish me for a relationship peccadillo ?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: it's just the circumstances! i don't think we can hang out anymore. i'm not even sure you're who you think you are. this rock demi-god</div>\n<div>- Amalia: do you mean Melkaro, the dwarven god?</div>\n<div>- Carlos: no, it's some other weird thing.</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Well we should take you to a healer, you're so confused. Come with me so I can take care of you.</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I ...</div>\n<div>- Amalia: I have no doubt you'll act independently, going off to pray to Aul&euml;, rubbing your hammer. -- Don't even think about coming near me; I'll slit your throat.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez prefers to just kill or just talk. So he attacks Laceleaf.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- [Laceleaf criticizes Fez's whip and Hellish Rebukes him. And then gets confused with metaphors. \"coming back by not going back\" -- Laceleaf is bad at telling stories and prefers partying.]</div>\n<div>- [Fez tries to convince her she's undead. Laceleaf learned how to throw fire being close to Moradin's forge in Torffeton, having volcanic power running through our bones]</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Ki-fueled strike. Dagger &amp; unarmed strike.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf: who's this gross piece of shit? and starts shading Hiero.</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf pulls out a 3 foot long bowie knife as Hiero runs away, wrenches a shield from one of the dead kobold's hands, pulling off the hand, and shouting ... something .&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf licks the scimitar, spreading a greenish-white saliva over the blade. Fez tries not to think about it, but is pretty convinced she covered it in poison.</div>\n<div>- [Ability: Saliva trick]</div>\n<div>- \"Your wiley friend there distracted me\"</div>\n<div>- Carlos attacks Laceleaf with his warhammer and conjures his spiritual weapon.</div>\n<div>- Fez attacks with divine smite attacks Laceleaf, who belittles his whip and Hellish Rebukes.</div>\n<div>- \"I hope you burn to death just like my parents froze to death\"</div>\n<div>- \"The earth was our class, and geometry was our professor, so I know all there is to know\"</div>\n<div>- also if you lose a cousin, you also have to discount a cousin you do have</div>\n<div>- \"What is the lungs but two holes that don't go nowhere?\"</div>\n<div>- Fez: Halflings can never turn down a dare to eat</div>\n<div>- [They start getting in on education and existentialism]</div>\n<div>- Heiro tosses Carlos a poison since Carlos wanted to see if Laceleaf could eat anything.</div>\n<div>- He runs behind her, mixes bat guano and sulfur in his mouth, and dips finger in bile lighter fluid and fireballs her.</div>\n<div>- He thus starts coronavirus</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf takes damage from fireball but almost gets out of the way.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- I have beautiful hair, thank you very much, you can't see it because of the chain mail hood I'm wearing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf trashes Fez with her bowie knife and wrathful smite. \"Maybe I'll even embrace this warm fighting\"</div>\n<div>- Drav spontaneously passes out.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Then Hiero does faerie fire with remainder of mouth fire, but Laceleaf avoids it because it was too weak, \"looks like you're too weak to even spit right\"</div>\n<div>- Laceleaf murders out cold Fez, grabs him by the ankle, and starts walking towards the stairs, leaving Rotrude's leeches behind. Fez's blood is too coagulated for the leeches to get in.</div>\n<div>- and Fez was always taught to keep your mouth closed when you fall unconscious</div>\n<div>- Carlos Preserve Life's Fez.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez trips Laceleaf who falls on her own sword and dissolves into a greenish-white puddle of salivary \"gluids\".</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>"}

Nyuaka's nightmares and their conspiratorial whispering wake Drav and, as yet unbeknownst to the crew, a goblin rune knight named Pjorg (the) Tallhearted down the hall, who had lost consciousness after consuming light exploded from archaic symbols he was studying. As Pjorg creeps towards the encampment, Vengeance is awoken by qi with the urge to swallow and steal as many of the azurite prisms as possible, only to become distracted by the curious pendants worn by the Ruhu family which Vengeance believes an emblem of The Order of Rust. With Eldar's help, Drav blends mystically into the rock floor as Pjorg bursts into the cave; Jean-Luc and Flick disappear into the shadows. Vengeance bagpipes nearly everyone awake, but Pjorg is so conspicuous in his clanging shiny plate armor that all attention focuses on him. After a bit of parlay, everyone decides he means no harm. Nevertheless, the main crew, suspicious of the possibly amnesiogenic azurite after hearing it called the \"Forgetting Stone,\" pick up their bedrolls and return to their landing above the Strigge River.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_1\">Alternate Titles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm going to address the good god-fearing people in the crowd now</li>\n<li>'What the kids are listening to' is 'writing things down'</li>\n<li>What is this Cronenberg shit?</li>\n<li>The Order of Rust</li>\n<li>Ruhu excuse us all</li>\n<li>FNNH (Freshly nerfed new hotness)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"toc_3\">Transcript</h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">Pj&ouml;rg</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pjorg has been underground for the last few weeks, tracing out the pattern of some ancient runes whose location he's pieces together by collecting clues and gossip relinquished to him as he's traveled across the continent. He's come down to this area even though its potention was thought to have been exhausted. The rumors were that there was still something to find of the stone runes. He's generally steered clear of people, gathering rumors from itinerant travelers and loners. At first he thought that the prevailing opinion had it right, but he eventually discovered something interesting. Pjorg isn't accustomed to being underground for this long, and has lost track of the days and nights. He'd just detected something through the walls of the cave, and had brewed up a concoction. paean to artificer path not taken. graphite, acidic exuvia from cave animal, and phosphorescent fungi, smeared it across the walls. Shining out at him, where he'd painted it, were the hints of runes he was looking for. As he peered closer, they glowed exceptionally bright, (he'd left his darkvision turned up too high), so bright that they eclipsed his vision, and he passed out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"toc_5\">day 14, 4:am, sleeping off the snake orgy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wisdom saving throw.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(At mightnight, Flick had found a corner with a good view of the main entrance, and gone into seiza (?) and gone into a trance.) She comes out of her trance, recollecting departing Sandford, coming north up the river, being transported across the river by Gerd, but can't quite recall where she is or what happened last night. She remembers entering a face and talking with people whose faces she can't recall, having a meal, and going to sleep. She recalls the salamander, and a lizardfolk, some humans, the earthen hand that grasped Jean-Luc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick glances around her, and looks for her companions. She sees Drav, but has to take a split-second to recognize V and Jean-Luc. They have bedded down behind a low stone wall. She can hear snoring and light breathing around them in the cave. Flick steps around lightly to get a sense of who's there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As she sees each of the sleeping figures, she can piece together who everyone is and what role they played, and recalls the events of the evening. She sees the giant salamander sitting next to a pile of purplish-blue crystal rods she doesn't remember seeing last night. She concludes that is none of her business, further turned off by the foul-smelling mucus coating them.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Constitution saving throw : 9</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She still doesn't feel like dry-heaving, and with her sensitive stomach, it would have caused her to throw up, but she thinks she couldn't have had that much to drink last night. And remembers that the beer was fairly watery.</p>\n<p>She immediately investigates for apothecary kits or something used to adulterate the drinks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They'd told her they were miningn iridium for a while, and got an early start on beer making; the vat has quite a crust, to indicate they've been drinking it for a while; if anything it is really \"stanky\" beer. She takes a sniff for infiltration of a fungus or bacterium.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A very low perception roll</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She doesn't detect a fungal presence. Because it's so close to Lhaska, her dry heat has probably prevented a lot of these harmful organisms forming in the first place. They may even have brought the beer vat with them to the cave.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Somebody is fucking with us, but I'm not sure what I can do about it.\"</p>\n<p>She does notice that everyone in the family is wearing a similar necklace; it looks like a gyroscope made of copper with a green patina.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>History 20</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She's positive that has nothing to do with clan symbols or a familiy per se. She's pretty sure it has religious or magical significance.</p>\n<p>V is curled up like a little spoon in JL's arms, as the latter had too much to drink. \"You know what, Vengeance, I know we fight a lot, but you're ok.\" He had said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Charmisma check?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They two are fairly close to each other, but Flick can reach a hand in, separate out JL, and jostle him awake. \"Hey JL, what do you remember about last night?\" He looks over at Vengeance and groans, but his recollection is as bad as Flick's. \"Why does it matter?\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: That's all I got, too. You're no stranger to how it feels to be drunk.</p>\n<p>JL takes a moment to reflect and realize that he's feeling a hazy fog rather than the effects of a hangover. This isn't alcohol.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight^&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL feels like his inability to remember the name \"Kriobolis\". \"I don't have a headache -- I guess it wouldn't be the first time some nefarious group drugged me. I'm sort of against just killing them all in their sleep.\"</p>\n<p>Flick: \"Yeah that hadn't even occurred to me. I was thinking\" (she gestured to Nyuka and Lhaska) \"... I get the feeling that, if anything is doing this to us, it's to be found in their satchel, and I was wondering if you could take the wheel.\"</p>\n<p>JL: Yeah, this is what I was made for.</p>\n<p>Nyaka comes close to waking up, but he freezes in just the right way, giving her just the right touch to coax her back to sleep. She shouts \"Killer whales!\" and then falls into a deep slumber. Then he starts looking through the satchel.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ADV to riffle through.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ignoring the baubles and trinkets, JL looks for drugs or poison. There are a few vials in there; he's seen some of this stuff. it's the Ys version of ecstasy. He leaves it in the satchel. He goes back and tells Flick that they bogarted the ecstasy, which is a party foul, but they could easily have killed us.</p>\n<p>Flick gets incredibly mad. This reminds her something that happened when she was a teen, and a bunch of the village boys tried to get her plastered in ignorance of Elven metabolism, and it went badly for them; there were broken bones, and one got lost in the woods and was never found again. It precipitated a generational feud between her family and these McmMurtons, only 2 of 3 brothers got through the night. to this day they can't be in the same area of town or they'll come to blows. Made even more awkward by the fact that it's their grandchildren and flick is still in her (relative) early 20s.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inspiration point!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What Flick gets out of it, is that they spiked their drinks (the only frame of reference she has for this).&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL notices how angry Flick is. From JL's perspective \"this is just what you do at parties: why would anyone be angry?\"</p>\n<p>Flick closes her eyes and tries to run through some meditative exercises. Would you rehearse for me the arguments that we shouldn't kill them. JL: If their intent was malicious, we would be dead or robbed, and they just gave us stuff to help us have a good time. How many parties have you been to? Flick: Not too many.</p>\n<p>For one of the generations, when Flick was \"the same age,\" she was a normal part of the social scene, but after they aged out, she stopped getting invited to things, so it's been a while since she's been invited to a party, and it's kindof what drove her to \"find her own fun\" in the woods.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception checks all around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav wakes up to the sound of JL and Flick whispering conspiratorily. Pjorg wakes up to hear far down the tunnell human voices; he had thought he was alone. They might be giants. Or demons. Given his unceremonious passing out, he's still wearing all of his shit. He rolls over onto his stomach, gets up, and tries to stealth down the corridor. He's still, despite the day/many years traveling in the armor, getting used to it, makes a fair amount of noise. \"I'm just not as loud as I could be\" he thinks.</p>\n<p>JL and Flick both hear the tinkle of metal coming down a fissure in the caves. \"Is this a fucking ambush\" flick says. JL: No. these guys have proven they're better than this. I'm not saying it shouldn't die.</p>\n<p>Drav wakes up (again). They are looking over towards the right hand side of the caves. She remains watchful, patting V on his head. He's yelling \"I'm wide awake!\" while asleep.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM allows V to spend 3 ki points to wake up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav realizes that V's head is disturbingly active as V rouses himself. \"I've been awake and trying to swallow\" rocks which he thought were the purple-blue crystalline rocks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>20 ft. per 6 seconds, doing an exorcist crawl.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav desperately tries to cover V's mouth, but he's too focused and slips through her ruddy dwarven fingers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Contested grapple check. V's perception check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As he awake, he hears a deliciously gloppy sound. A fresh, crystalline blue turdlike object emerge from Lhaska's butthole as she burps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rolling initiative for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick sees ...</p>\n<p>V: Let's not cause any commotion. I don't want to wake anyone up. I just thought we could take a few of these as a party favor or souvenir.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lhaska turns about restlessly and settles back into sleep. Flick runs over and tries to grapple Vengeance. The memory of the boys trying to roofie Flick ... no! she gets Vengeance face-down in a wrestling hold.</p>\n<p>Flick: V, can I persuade you to abandon this course of action? V: Yeah, use me like a vacuum, and I'll suck up as many of these things as possible. Flick: What if I were to put you back over where we were sleeping. V: I don't think they'll suspect a thing; you should also try to swallow as many as you can. Flick: Vengeance I want you to try to remember what happened last night. V: I don't remember much.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav and V both got 18s, so remember everything from last night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: You don't remember anything because they poisoned us; these azurite bars, you don't want to swallow them. (But then Flick realizes that V is lying, but can't figure out why he would be. She gives his left wrist a twist) \"Could you please tell me the truth, I feel like this is important.\" V: The important thing is we get out of here with as many of these gems as we can. F: Why is this suddenly so important to you? V: They told us last night this is one of the most powerful substances that exists. Thank god we're the only people that know about it -- now's the time to act.</p>\n<p>Flick lets V go at this point. (It's possible they did say this and Flick can't remember.)</p>\n<p>Scunner is in a satiated thieves' sleep, believing everything to be safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav wants to make her way very slowly to Flick and Vengeance and ask what's going on. Eldar has provided her with protection in the past; Drav does something akin to prayer to Eldar</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And fails an insight/religion check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav reaches out to Eldar and feels like her spirit is more difficult to communicate with than it was in the past. It feels like she's been out over where Pjorg came came in from, and is distracted -- \"there's so many interesting symbols and hieroglyphs over here.\" and her attention is lost.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav makes a loud noise and sees \"Glunt\" wake up -- the sister. (Sister to Haigy, daughter of Jarisma, wakes up, and looks over at the group of you). She sees the wrestling and the group of them, drav in the distance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc starts humming a lullaby to try to get her to fall back asleep. Vengeance reaches towards his bagpipes ... to accompany . She is just about to fully awake. Drav recalls blindness/deafness in Riult's spellbook? She sees Flick mouthing \"Mage Hand!\" from across the dim room, and makes it appear behind Glunt's head, like \"this is your mother singing a lullaby\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>spell attack on riult's mage and then performance check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the gritty sounds of the lullaby combined with the soothing touch of invisible mage hand coaxes glunt back to sleep. JL injected a kriobolis-specific lullaby into things, maybe a GM sleeper cell sleeping song ?</p>\n<p>Flick: I think we should bed down for the rest of the night and take things when we're clearer in the head.</p>\n<p>Vengeance breaks off his bagpipe playing, emitting a \"record scratch\" upon seeing once of the amulets, whispering \"The Order of Rust!\" and whispers, \"Yes, just as I thought\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance thinks aloud, back to his stepmother Dagonnara, and her son, the wicked Schlonzel, who wanted to join the Order of Rust, and practicing his Rust magic in a way that impressed V's father that caused V's father to favor Schlonzel even tho Schlonzel was not V's father's son.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>V Intelligence check. He believes his story. (I don't remember if this was a high or low roll)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg continues down the hallway as quietly as possible. bringing him about to 90 feet away.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>20 perception to hear what was going on in there 1d240; 225; 13 -- average. ? 120 feet away from the group when he hears this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Breg did not wake up. Vengeance is still thinking about the order of rust and his father and the wicked schlonzel and how V's father always said he should be more like him, because everything he touched turned to rust.</p>\n<p>V has been told he's a half-elf, but supposedly his mother was the elf. Either way, he did have a step-mother, Daggonara, who has Schlonzel, she trained him from the time he was a little scamp in the order of rust, because that's what she wanted him to join, and by the time he grew up he was the worst person that V had ever met. Everyone loved him and thought he was amazing. (His mother, the elf, was never around). He could immediately change the properties of certain metals so they could do things like Rust slightly more quickly. (He was ionized?).&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intelligence check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, everything he's saying totally checks out in terms of what he remembers. It's all coming together now.</p>\n<p>Vengeane goes flat against the ground and moves his hands as though crawling, drav pushing slightly against his forehead, both of them together preventing any forward movement.</p>\n<p>Vengeance sees a bluish-colored stone with a great deal of mucus coating it in front of him that would be great to slurp down. \"I'll slurp it.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Constitution check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance swallows a brick-sized stone somehow. In the gizzard he thinks works to digest his food he thinks it will be particularly efficacious.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL looks for a good place to hide to ambush Pjorg. JL moves to the opposite side of the room from where he's going to pop out.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stealth 27, JL is hidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick hears the same thing, moving over to one of the low stone walls. Drav moves back. Then, without quite realizing it, Pjorg pops out into the open room. to his right are 4 sleeping humans, up and to the right a huge salamander with a pile of gems and another lizardfolk behind it sleeping; directly ahead of him (80 feet away; it's lit from the salamander) a monk face-down on the rocks who looks like he's trying to eat more rocks. and at the edge of his vision, a few more figures in the far distance. (Drav manages to hide! a historic day! Eldar swooped back to Drav to cover her up.)</p>\n<p>Pjorg, having stumbled into this room full of people, knows that something weird has happened. Are there rocks that HE can get behind. He thinks that his rhythms aren't synchronized with those of these people, whoever they are.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a very bad stealth check?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav, as Eldar rushed back, she scintillated against a bunch of foreign armor, and the sparks of her spirit passage make clear that there's a goblinoid hiding behind the rocks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL sees the entrance and attempt to hide of a goblin fully outfitted in gilded plate armor carrying a very large battle axe who ducks down behind some rocks quite obviously, and even V notices.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL insight as to his intentions. It's weird that he walked into the room and hid.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He's kind of baffled. (But Pjorg is also pretty baffled) \"He's hiding in ... the rocks...\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Raw intelligence&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick, Drav remember -- Flick can kind fo feel it, Drav remembers that Fundi was talking about establishing a hallowed ground , so it's consecreated ground; the specific effect is that everyone in the circle can communicate even if they can't speak the same language, which they were told was to talk to Ruhu, but it lets them talk to the lizardfolk and brittle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the party, Brittle was all \"Get Smashed!\"</p>\n<p>JL is so confident that he blends totally into the shadows, gliding like a ghost next to Flick; Flick is actually surprised when he comes up next to her. Pjorg has no idea. JL's breath moves one of her stray curls. JL inwardly curses that it wasn't perfect. Flick feels for a moment the raw sexuality felt by Nyaka with JL earlier.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"are you watching that goblin too? he doesn't seem to mean any harm. should we ... see what he wants?\" JL: \"Also, who wanders into a mining cave ... by accident?\" Flick: \"Remember when you wandered into the death-knight's naked wrestling circle.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception rolls</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick notices that the armor of the creature is slightly dulled by a patina of dust. Vengeance: \"dust, or ... RUST?!?!\" Flick: He is armed to the teeth, but he's not ready for burgling. he can't be here to take advantage of us. Vengeance: he kindof remeinds me of someone. Do you remember our friend Fez we left for dead at that snake hospital?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We discuss whether or not Vengeance can even see Pjorg. he fails a stealth check so hard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The guy on the floor pulls out his bagpipes and Frampton comes alive it.</p>\n<p>V: \"Do you remember Fez?\"</p>\n<p>Drav desperately regrets giving Vengeance a little breathing room.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL agrees with Flick that this goblin is probably not here for something nefarious. As V's bagpipes fill the air with cacophony, Flick concludes all the people are about to wake up. She uses Fleet of Foot&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both Scunner and Lhaska wake up at this point. Lhaska, being a huge salamander, looks over to Nyaka and licks her. Scunner wakes up, and immediately sees Pjorg after being awoken by the bagpipe. and he nudges Breg: \"we've got a newcomer here. Looks to be alone.\"</p>\n<p>Drav stays hidden with her unprecedented 17 stealth. ready to cast a spell if needed.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick has a full rest, everyone else has the equivalent of 2 short rests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav rolls for Eldar. She feels the spirit of Eldar infusing her; because she's sitting on the cave floor, she can see the rocks crawl up her and disguise her; once per long rest she can make a stealth check with advantage if she's still and touching rock or stone.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Glunt rolls a nat 1, so she stays asleep, but the other three do wake up. she remains fully out of it. the other three are disoriented, but awoke from bagpipe music.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Haigy, the one who attended the same charter school that JL did.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They were awoken by the bagpipe, but only see Pjorg, and respond to Scunner's shout. They, shout, \"Is this one of the Hat Baskets? They know that this Azurite is ours -- we only had a deal with them for the Iridium.\" and they start gathering up their weapons ...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brittle looks at what's going on and goes back to sleep. Pjorg, it's clear almost everyone has seen him glinting in the soft orange light from Lhaska.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Greetings, small ones, and appropriately sized lizars! My name is Pjorg Tallheart! Scunner: Is that it?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roll for Introduction. (Persuasion) -- 11</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I mean you no harm! (which is true) (he looks like a moderately sized piece of fools gold) \"I am embarrassingly slightly lost in this cave and was awoken by the sound of squabbling voices.</p>\n<p>The humans closest to him look at him scepticaly. FUndi , the elder is closest, and they are all kind of giggling behind him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"I do not mean to appear threatening. Is it the battle axe that I hold in my extremely large hands? or is it the greataxe strapped to my extremely large back\"</p>\n<p>Fundi: young boy, dn't you see the ribbon we've established . this is a itual circle, you can't just come in here. in fact, let me know about anyone you've had sex with who wasn't married to you. this is of paramount importance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg: I am adept at reading multiple scripts and would ahve noticed signage to this effect in the hallway. and would ahve noticed such a warning.</p>\n<p>Fundi looks around himself, realizes he's telling the truth, reaches into a fanny pack and pulls out a ribbon and ties it to the stone just to his left and strings it across in front of you. Flick: that is&nbsp;very&nbsp;unfair ex post facto ordinancing! Fundi: As you can see there is a ribbon here and you may cross it by no means and you can't cross it unless you answer my questions to see if you'll corrupt this ritual space. Pjorg: that sounds totally reasonable except for your placing of the ribbon at this time. Fundi: To be honest, I hadn't known there was an entrance from this direction and otherwise I would ahve placed it here earlier. As you can see, I've placed one where accidental visitors might have entered and had to be allowed forwards after answering the questions. Ruhu excuse us all. Pjorg (to himself) \"not the true ... order of rust.\" \"I can answer your question in one simple statement of phrase.\" and he shows Fundi the rune on his shield. [The rune looks like a burning half of a cursive letter f] Flick shouts: It's the poon rune, am I right, up top! V: there better be some Poon-itive action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Galen gets his only ever inspiration point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg isn't invoking it, he's just showing it to him.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidateion 8</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg: You see the shield symbolizes protection, what one must always use, but i have protection because of the celibacy oath that my order swears. Fundi takes a look. It appears to just make the shield weaker where it's been carved. but if you do subscribe to an oath of celibacy then you are welcome across the ribbon. Flick feels almost ontologically embarrassed by her attempt to make the pun. She flashed back to times at the Dacha where none of her humor was appreciated.</p>\n<p>Flick: Elven jokes are really long because they live for so long; they are like shaggy dog stories, and this 20 minute long joke that ends with ... a chief was going to have a baby, and the warriors had to get hippopotamus hide, and a pythagorus joke. JL is the only one who hears Flick whispering this to herself. Vengeance: Did you hear the one about the three elves wandering through the woods where the foo creature lives? JL is so annoyed that he sighs so loud he comes out of stealth. \"Flick for the love of Ruhu shut up with these stories.\" and then he realizes where he is . and the entire famiy turns to look at him.</p>\n<p>[2:02]</p>\n<p>Breg walks out into the center of things, rubbing literal grit from her eyes which accumulates as she sleeps. \"Everybody quiet down what the hell is going on here. Why isn't everyone asleep? This is perfect sleeping weather for a dwarf.\"</p>\n<p>Pjorg (in dwarven): is it perfect sleeping weather? I'm disoriented in this underground space. Breg: Oh, a member of the tribes. I see that Fundi has already allowed you into the hallowed circle. Please introduce yourself. Pjorg: I am, once again, Pjorg the Tallhearted, which is ... we usually leave out the \"the\". The tallhearted clan, i've not heard of them. Breg: is the tallhearted a dwarven clan? Pjorg: you can probably detect my accent . I've only learned the formal forms. Breg: you must have studied from a religious text with the older grammar and syntax. Come in, it's not even clear to me where you've come from.</p>\n<p>Lhaska starts 'barking' very loudly.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Did I hear someone mention Azurite, the blood of the titan Azuroth? Breg: I've never heard it called under that name, but yes, Azurite, for sure. Pjorg: Oh, I've conflated it with a different Azurite. Breg: You may also know that it's called The Forgetting Stone. Pjorg: That may explain why I can't determine how long I've been underground. Breg: Yes, how close have you been to us? Pjorg: That, too, remains unclear to me. I was searching for ... something? But the journey led me. All these corridors kind of look the same. Breg: Well yes they've been carved out over thousands of years by the action of the water. I'm surprised you're still alive, as there's not much to eat down here. Pjorg: not luck as some but luckier than many. Breg: that's very vague. I like to be literally and figuratively concrete. (She still can't locate drav in the cave.) No matter, I'm sure she's asleep. Dwarves are very good sleepers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick realizes that hostilities aren't going to commence, so she steps out into the open. V: Everyone relax, everything should be fine. (He cocks his self-killer and throws it at Jarisma to cut the necklace off her neck. He uses all of his hatred of Schlonzel to focus his attack.)&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He rolls a 5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>V pulls his selfkiller out and tosses it towards the Ruhu family. With the extra grease he's been crawling through it sorts of slides out of his hand along the floor towards them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight for the Ruhu family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jarisma and Glunt, the daughter, who was asleep: \"This asshole is trying to attack us!\" Haigy looks sympathetic, \"Hold on, I think he's just hungover. This is just some kind of drinking game he's a part of.\" Glunt and Jarisma are making their way towards him to teach him a lesson.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav finally comes out of stealth, standing in front of rocks, and runs over to restrain Vengeance again. Drav just manages to smash Vengeance's head ungently into the cave floor while shouting out an apology. \"Sorry we're still working on him. Just ... \" she shrugs. They look sympathetic and cast an eye back towards Haigy. \"You sure you got him? We've had to deal with the same sort of thing with this guy. Hormones at their age, right?\" And then they exchange looks with each other because Vengeance is rapidly losing his hair. But they relax with Drav in control.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL, operating on the assumption they are not going to attack Vengeance, stays hidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nyaka: Has everyone been woken up by this goblin? Flick: Yes. Pjorg: I'm&nbsp;notresponsible for the vast majority of the commotion. I was awoken by commotion of my own. Nyaka: Fundi, did you offer him opportunity to answer the question? Fundi: yes, he answered with flying colors, and I've pushed the ropes down for him, but he hasn't offered anything as far as libations or victuals are concerned. Nyaka: I'm not in the mood right now anyway, just make sure he stays quiet. (She looks at her satchel quizzically and settles back to sleep)</p>\n<p>Flick; What's happened here is a bit strange; hopefully we can stay friends after this; this tallhearted goblin means us no harm; let's finish the night's rest, and then tomorrow we can all head back. Breg: I'm fine with that ... arrangements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The humans come towards Pjorg with thick twists of tobacco. Fundi: would you like to help us get back to sleep? and holds out a giant stogie. They are sitting sort of crosslegged in a makeshift circle but it's clear they're ready to pass out too. JL joins the circle. JL notices that he has to make up for the fact that Pjorg doesn't join. Jarisma: What's up with this goblin? Why isn't he smoking with us? JL: to each their own, let's just enjoy this fine ... slake. We're all just people living in a cave. Jarisma: well we do want to get out of here. JL: Man, you guys worry too much. They look at him a bit sceptically ; in return he takes a huge puff of the blunt. Jarisma slaps him on the back heartily, All right, yeah, you're a steady one, I'll fall in line with that. They start telling each other clan-related stories. Maybe a few tales about their lineage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg refuses to join the circle and goes sitting off by himself.</p>\n<p>JL is too baked to avoid Vengeance.</p>\n</section>"}

F. Wylmott</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before bedding down for the night, Flick pressed Isabella and Lupenna on the true purpose of their plan to disguise Isabella as Lupenna while the latter skipped from plane to plane to catch @JournalEntry[Mjd6QQ11FAmPlPY3]{Tantegorische}. They demurred slightly when considering the arrangement in retrospect, but Isabella remained convinced that she couldn't have tended the castle in her true form without causing terror amongst the townsfolk. Flick retired rather than adumbrate a detailed genealogy with her godmother and half-aunt, and the gang awoke the next morning to delicious stacked pancakes and an invitation to assist Isabella with research into @JournalEntry[NmtPt8bB0bOvvEWF]{Boggshosh}, the elder god. Drav and Paros, delighted by the offer, perused old tomes with Carlos at the ready in case of overexertion. Drav, ever in command of her faculties, discovered texts on the ancient rituals of Boggshuosh cultists and a loose leaf from a memoir concerning @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{Sirmgalv}. Paros, lost in contemplation, was Veenock'ed around and put in mind of a primeval rivalry between the evil spirit and the demon @JournalEntry[YHSLeWMhkn639jCi]{Nundocamar}; he was further tasked with the recovery of an onyx ring with great psionic powers.</p>\n<p>Flick and Joan, meanwhile, took advantage of the crisp fall air and trekked to the North Tower, which they discovered to be more of a waystation for happenstansical travelers. Flick immediately ransacked the workshed and pilfered a pair of sealskin gloves and an unexpectedly strong rope woven out of fizzlecyst silk. Joan, convinced the tower housed eggs in need of protection, attempted to open the door from the downside up, and in so doing alerted the resident, Hale Clotwool, who introduced herself as a herder. Greeted also by the music inside (<em>Straight out the butte: never gonna' plateau</em>, by @JournalEntry[IjOdh6fNMM51Ydqe]{The Young Fustics}), the smells of a rich second breakfast, and the inquisitive head of a laid-up <em>turr</em> named @JournalEntry[bi76sP1LQcEgLZ7k]{Orbell Daedonbashur}, Joan and Flick assisted in repairing the door and casing the joint. Flick's heightened @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{conusance} of @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{portalian} japery, however, shattered the placid free-for-all and brought her face to face with an avatar of Juniper Three School; together they inferred that the reddish-gold ingots (@JournalEntry[2ZjwRb6atEoekzAW]{zlott}) were somehow altering the planar coherence around Egg Three School.</p>\n<p>By early afternoon everyone had reconvened at Castle Karn, just in time to witness an efflorescent belch of petals aflame exploding from Tobolux's @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{berninde}. It took Paros's increasingly worrisome familiarity with Veenock to make an assay at the truth: demonic @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{BaphOMO} got sloppy attempting to influence the current cosmological detente on @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{Thuslubber} and killed some 'weak and tasty' @JournalEntry[J8gk7RTTA0Ziyego]{bloemenwet}. Domonkos and Lupenna, unbothered by the general goings-on, began to draft up the details for an immortal castle timeshare, and the group headed towards @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{An Sr&aacute;idbhaile}. It quickly became necessary to implement 'ghost fog protocol,' involving, in part, mental exercises to prevent subconscious resentment of people considered mediocre; but, even perceptive Flick was taken unawares upon stumbling into Grenlich's @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{immor}. As Joan rushed forward to embrace the future of humanoid-manity, the other adventurers did what they could to injure the poor unfortunate gnoll, in pain, in need.</p>\n<section>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h1>Transcript</h1>\n<p>PUTTY voice</p>\n<p>underside of a portobello mushroom (gills / laminae)</p>\n<p>starting: just took a long rest soul rock was taking a bath the last they saw him</p>\n<p>flick: they never revealed themselves to me; my foster parents never revealed themselves to me; they let me keep the wolf; snav did not mention isabelle; and maybe he thought that isabelle was lupenna who was locked away in the bear vase (snav sent us to castle karn in the first place)</p>\n<p>Remy Flitch ?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Isabella as an Oni can change her size and form and appearance; acting as Lupenna while lupenna was out hunting down Tantegorisch.

&nbsp;for religious followers, the abilities are granted by who they pray to<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp;paros can just take bracer off; the bracelet is also phoenix's calling card, since she moves around a lot<br />-&nbsp;

After blocking their ears to avoid the effect of a flock's song, these travelers attempt to mimic the strange hooting and chirping of a dire corby, with these creatures' simple minds making success surprisingly easy. Accepted as part of the flock, a traveler can range across the Underdark escorted by hundreds of humanoid creatures that the other predators of the depths take pains to avoid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Screaming Devilkin</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">mysteries / types of clues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">&nbsp;Incredibly hardy monsters such as catoblepas and gorgons have sometimes been observed with deep pockmarks showing where juvenile assassin bugs have emerged from their bodies.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">kids turning into Deep Ones</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">fog giant:&nbsp;</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">kind of bandit leader</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">eye of fear and flame</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">gems: If its commands are not obeyed, an eye of fear and flame throws back its hood to reveal its skull&mdash;set with gems of red and black in each eye socket&mdash;then attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">moral choices:</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The undead seeks to corrupt vulnerable individuals, especially those of lawful or good alignments, by setting tasks that test its targets' moral foundations.&nbsp; (eye of fear and flame)</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">mechanics</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Corrode Metal.

[Persuasion 9]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Queen: I could grant you immunity, as you invoked me, but no you are an intruder, and have merely taken the sacred entrails and brought them here, where they can revive us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hier [WIS 17]: Taken by a vision of the Queen as the full summer sun at the sky&rsquo;s zenith, heat waves pushing him further and further into the ground with each effulgent pulse, and the approaching eclipse that would have blocked off all sunlight forever. He backs up a step or two as he regains his composure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jean-luc examines the scepter. [HISTORY 11]. The Queen resembles certain harvest deities; the scepter allows her to choose between the specific role she is adopting, or which aspect or facet of her being she&rsquo;s prioritizing. He nocks an arrow and waits for a target.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flick arrests the progress of Rovine as the latter inches his way along the wall, presumably making for the open exit. Before getting a word in edgewise Rovine evinced surprise at the appearance of the hitherto unrevealed elf and the strength of her bosky mephitis. - Do you know Isabella? to which the oni asked in turn for any more insight on the intentions of his sister, and</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What connection do you have to this temple? to which: I am here by happenstance after the kobolds recently came upon it as an attractive site for their sacrificial rites.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flick: If i let you escape without revealing your position to the Queen, could we meet up later and chat about Tantegorisch and defending myself against him?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rovine: You certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;letting&rdquo; me.

(and makes to call over to her)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rovine, calling the bluff, declares them both at risk should her attention be redirection from Hieronymus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The two continue bickering over whose departure from the Temple is more urgent, until Rovine offers to discuss anything Flick wanted to on the Temple ground.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flick: Well, in the meantime, Isabella sends her regards, and my name is Flick. Does that name sound familiar to you?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rovine: Yes, it does. Isabelle has talked about you I believe. I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s gone into that much detail. From what i remember, your name wasn&rsquo;t to be brought up. I think she was deep in her cups and that&rsquo;s how mention of you came about. You were supposed to be something of a secret.

Looks like the \"faux-gaelic\" equivalent of a thieves' guild bar / tourist trap. Or, visiting a Tony Roma's in Japan.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What would this actually mean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick sees on the way a tavern called&nbsp;@JournalEntry[8XACK56SU24j3ru8]{The Triggered Beta}, which used to advertise with handbills around her family's pastoral home. The shingle is a picture of a colorful fish wearing a mis-buttoned button-down shirt with a loosened tie and uncombed hair, the complexion of Gormflaith, reading a copy of [Ys's version of Dubliners] with a cartoonish tear running down its face. However, she continues on towards the tourist trap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Behind the bar is someonen wearing&nbsp;; half-pirate, half-thief; they haven't decided on a&nbsp;mise en couture, and she appears to be a spry 90 year old woman serving people at a fast pace. Inside it's bumping, if dim, and some kind of artificial fog or smoke is being produced for effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc always sits in the corner facing the door; the only corner spot was occupied by a group of rowdy young women. He's in the same booth with them just to get a corner seat, and they keep trying to pull him into whatever drinking game they are playing. Jean-Luc joins the drinking game, and gives them his real name, \"Jean-Luc\".</p>\n<p>Flick, stepping in, hears, over the din, a group of excited voices chanting \"JEAN-LUC\" JEAN-LUC. and he heads towards it. he's being forced to eat a four-layer sponge cake with pink buttercream icing. they have mimosas. and there is a small ramekin of tres leches syrup, and someone mixes in some of their bloody mary. JLsy points widly to his new friends: \"Hey guys why don't you all join in.\" Jean-Luc waives over the bartender, Frankie Shapa, to bring him more tureens of buttercream icing and melted tres leches cream. Barkeep, another sugarmilk!</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc knows to himself that he's acting more drunk than he is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deception ++</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He's pulling off this ruse fabulously. Even Flick is taken in; she's a little miffed because it appears that one of her companions is drunk at a bridal shower, and they have to meet the hat baskets at an unspecified time later today. JL, seeing how successful his pretense is, finds a moment to whisper to Flick, \"I'm not really this drunk.\" Flick doesn't know how to participate in this scene. JL slides the buttermilk over to Flick. \"Down it goes!\" she says resignedly. Flick's barely able to keep it down, but feels it rising up and resting in her throat.</p>\n<p>JL: \"Let me take care of my friend here,\" and pulls her aside.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav is a 6 or 7 height-measurement. (quantum bit measurement? or it's in radians?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav looks curiously at one of the women at the table, but shakes her head and falls in Jean-Luc's wake. Flick fails to notice Drav's double-take. Flick tells JL about the Fountain of Elegance, and her belief they have about 2 hours before they're found. JL: We'd better try to find a ledger, then. They will probably demand to see the goods... wait, did we agree on payment? Flick: I ... dont remember? JL: AHhhhhhhhh, I'm losing my edge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What with recovering from the explosion, and Jean-Luc's assumption that he was still auditioning/ingratiating himself to the HB, he let it slip. \"I'm not a forger -- forgery was never my wheelhouse\" he declares to the group, though carving out a significant exception for realm-estate paperwork. \"we should find an old book and see what we can do\"</p>\n<p>Flick: I'm wondering if we can do it through magical means. None of us seem very crafty. That interesting fellow here, --- gnome magic tends towards the glamours and the interesting falsehoods. i wonder if he could make a book enough to show them. I think that's better than spending 2 hours pasting gold leaf onto some first edition or other. (Flick does remember that Jaap offered to make writing appear in realtime on the ledger)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: so let's get a fake-ass book, and put the title on it. JL bids Shapa and the ladies a theatrical farewell. We also have to find Pjorg and Jaap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance, elsewhere, thinks to himself, \"could my flower hat become a book?\" it could... but it wouldn't look a whole lot like a logbook.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apropos of nothing, Flick really wants to let fly.</p>\n<p>Melford had said that there are the gnomes who own a printing press in town, who might have remaindered books; there's also a Society of Stationers.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CHA check 15, makes it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">Society of Stationers public journal shop</h2>\n<p>Flick managers to find the journal shop, essentially. They have books so precisely delineated it's easy to find what they're looking for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance, wandering around town with Roxfallanah, thinks back to the anal mucus he swallowed. When he was a child, his father and step-mother attempted to start a side-hustle making and selling perfumes, so they had a beaver farm for a while -- except you can't relly farm beavers. They hda a bunch of irrigation channels for the beavers to build dams on; they accidentally flooded their valley and house, and that became the fishing lake of later, as they had to move higher and higher. He learned to fish by attempting to fish their belongings out of the flooded house; the only fishing he was good at. As his step-mother learned what really pushed his buttons, she would complain about his inability to provide \"The gift of the first skin\" to the water, which is a tradition after which a child is born, the placenta is offered to the sea creatures as a kind of future exchange for fish. But, since he doesn't know where he came from, they didn't have access to it. That's why it was thought he would always be a bad fisherperson.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That did baffle his father, stepmother, and Schlonzel because they were all bad at fishing for inanimate objects. So he remembers milking the beavers' castor sacs, for the exudations; Lhaska's anal mucus was similar to that, a sort of vanilla-pine scent; maybe there's a possibility for a commercial enterprise.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone's clothing is not described, they are wearing pastels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fishing competition now called The Magnificent Sandford Fishing Jostle and Menagerie. One of the judges has a very long, but white, john-waters style moustache.? Sinve Vengeance now has the taste of \"beavermilk\" in his mouth, he's running around town looking for that; while also looking for the Order of Rust. But he bypassed a large sign advertising such, but the stationery's society next to it had rust on its sign, so he went in there. And that's where the party was.</p>\n<p>Pjorg folds a hastily made, if carved and foldable, \"Order of Rust\" sign, which he'd been holding at goblin height, almost like a sandwich board, -- but Pjorg did sign twirling, like most Goliath children. they would twirl these for the cultural meal known as the Qui'Natz Haderach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_5\">Jaap sees some ghouls</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cut to ... Jaap behind the olive barrels at a trade goods store.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap approaches the shopkeeper, \"I notice these ghoulish, pale people lumbering outside here, at the pier. What are they doing around here.\" Shopkeep: Can you point them out to me? Jaap points in their direction. The shopkeep looks: Hey bud I don't know what games you're trying to play, but if your ruse is to distract me while one of your buddies steals something, you can just leave now. It's clear you're not pointing at anything at all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaap Insight high</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap believes that the shopkeep indeed does not see anything. \"Sorry I must have eaten something bad -- I'll leave you to your work.</p>\n<p>Shopkeep: hey, no problem, listen, i shouldn't leave this olives out uncovered nearly as long as I do, so consider us even.</p>\n<p>Jaap: oh, that's where the smell is coming from.</p>\n<p>Shopkeep: Some people like it, they say it smells alot like certain perfumes...</p>\n<p>Jaap leaves the store and approaches someone in the plaza. They also are unable to stop what JJ is pointing at. \"Hey are you ok little dude, maybe you need to go find your mom.\" Jaap lets it go: people make that mistake all the time.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arcana / Investigation . 12. [I guess I should have asked for a use of Detect Magic?

The TMK through the Elven city of Elsh Ta'El began trading with the pastroralists who came into the city to exchange, and it uses the Nor river as access to Honeyfall sea.

This latter approach proves its merit when Thaz, a stealthy outposted guard, gets the drop on Flick's hedge-creeping. The magician Mezlar brokers systatic [commendatory] introductions of not only the gnolls but a greedy pig named Gribble which Carlos believes to be out of Paros's romantic league. After Thaz impresses them with hearty calisthenics, Mezlar offers as bivouac the empty home of a recently deceased community member. Flick, ever the detective, describes the \"fetus mushrooms\" seen earlier that day to Mezlar, who instantly recognizes the creatures detailed. One of the gnolls, Kolmy Shortpaw, had, a few months ago, moved north of the village near an expanse of desecrated ruins, and renamed herself Grenlich. The gnolls had been rooting out and burning the hodmandods, but a report of them so far from the village was worrisome; such expansion indicated that Grenlich, once trained by Mezlar's father in techniques now forsworn by the village, could become a sore threat soon.</p>\n<p>Mining Mezlar further for renseignements, the group learns that Joan's black orb can instantly impart a year's worth of solid core training to one employing its power, and that the material substance of Flick's figurine bears similarities to an onyx-like stone quondam [formerly] mined nearby. At this point, Joan ceremoniously burnes Dravita in the town bonfire, and everyone, exhausted by recent travails, betakes themself of a nocturnal rest.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Flick abraids [awakes] to the cool 'magical cleansing' tongue of 'Jasper and the Lady Violet' (<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-157e22db-7fff-584b-df9d-5a77955c35fc\">an intelligent horse who lives with gnolls; a practiced surveyor and mathematician</span>) and its porcine friend. Trivialities are soon shoved aside, though, as a gnoll trapper is carried into town having had his heart torn out. Almost simultaneously a bevy of winged hodmandods flies into the village, petrifies most of the congregated with horrendous shrieks, and makes to extract the life-force from the dead trapper. A misplaced lightning sneeze from Joan allows one of the creatures to bud a landbound form, and in the fight at least one gnoll is splashed with a sticky ichor before the monsters take flight. Hoping to provide aid, the adventurers meet with @JournalEntry[t5NE2hDtR8aQwEy3]{Lorekeeper Brak Shortpaw}, sister to Kolmy, who reveals that the trapper's heart had been removed by a not unfamiliar harpy-like creature, and that the appearance of the hodmandods was likely an unfortunate coincidence. Apprised of these new developments, the gang takes a moment to regroup and steel themselves for their next step.</p>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>joan burns dravita</p>\n<p>how many of the small potatoes die ?</p>\n<p>so there&rsquo;s the heartless gnoll (metaphor), and the spit-on nurse gnoll</p>\n<p>will burnt dravita come back in a dream ? or otherwise ?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p>[0:0]</p>\n<p>group of 6 gnolls approaching</p>\n<p>party has come into the gnoll village</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>joan wants to be able to just go up and say hi to people, not make checks</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[0:3]</p>\n<p>gribble and pigs trot over</p>\n<p>knives described</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>paros wants to find the pig thing that he saw earlier</p>\n<p>jake &ldquo;have mezlar tell him that pig&rsquo;s out of his league&rsquo;</p>\n<p>flick convinced by joan&rsquo;s friendliness (amicable, neighborly, sociable, genial)</p>\n<p>matt: &ldquo;a pig&rsquo;s going to swipe right on you&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[x] &ldquo;swine&hellip; right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[0:4]</p>\n<p>one of gnolls gets drop on Flick, wearing leather armor</p>\n<p>THAZ - sort of like british &ldquo;eh, chap&rdquo; type</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>gribble says &ldquo;hi&rdquo; really loudly</p>\n<p>looking for food. knows people lie when they say they don&rsquo;t have food.</p>\n<p>pigs are knee-height; flick gives berries; pigs come over; flick casts the berries&nbsp;</p>\n<p>gribble (female) is greediest</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[0:9]</p>\n<p>(ian recounts finding the fetus mushroom)</p>\n<p>Thaz does some calisthenics</p>\n<p>&nbsp;when the gnolls walk back to their houses</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Mezlar does talk to Joan</p>\n<p>Mezlar asks Joan if they still need place to stay</p>\n<p>one of the gnolls living at a home died recently, offers them the center of the village , not the central lodge</p>\n<p>[0:11]</p>\n<p>reactions to the mushroom fetus : &ldquo;oh god, where did you find this?&rdquo; &ldquo;a few hours? her range must be expanding&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;one of us who is up to really dangerous experimentation, and we&rsquo;ve seen these things cropping up. we eradicate as soon as we see them. they are designed to be evil&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;no longer considers herself one of us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;her name used to be KOLMY - a few months ago she decided she didn&rsquo;t want to live amongst us any more.

Flick is in the mix downstairs, and had a \"totally sweet swashbuckling dive off the stairway.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick gently links elbows with Aphelia and turns to Alphalpha. \"Well, if there&rsquo;s nothing futher, we have some outside to be in, so thanks and take care!\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_2\">The Badge of @JournalEntry[Cjp3YCQAnyI7gN2Y]{Tepplin}; or, Constable Yncharj</h2>\n<p>Jean-luc takes the silver star out of his bag and waves it like a badge of authority. \"It&rsquo;s ok guys, I&rsquo;m going to take it from here. I&rsquo;ve been tracking these two for a while now. Don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m going to take them to justice. Of course, the young lady will have to give testimony, but I promise to have her back in an hour.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deception 11</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The nearest elph to Jean-luc, Dalpholph (sporting a sweet navy blue mohowk and wearing diagonally striped green and orange robes).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dalpholph: What makes you think that an agent wielding the Star of Tepplin can exercise any authority here?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investigation 11</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jean-luc recognizes the name Tepplin; he knows it not to be a religious symbol. He knows enough about what it isn&rsquo;t to recognize that what Dalpholph has said about its impotence here is probably correct.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-luc: Where I&rsquo;m from, Tepplin is revered.</li>\n<li>Dalpholph: Oh, so you&rsquo;re from Albland</li>\n<li>JL: Of course</li>\n<li>Dalpholph: Seems a bit mercantilist to revere the star of a well-known brewer and distiller out in Albland.</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: They make a really good brew; and it turns out that these people are wanted because they&rsquo;ve been trying to steal our secret recipe.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Persuasion 21</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dalpholph: It&rsquo;s not like us to respect intellectual property in that way? I&rsquo;ve been hearing a lot about it, too: People laying claim to secret recipes rather than putting them in the open. That&rsquo;s a risk that Baronian takes: if the recipe is secret, and he doesn&rsquo;t patent it, then if it&rsquo;s stolen, that&rsquo;s it, he has no recourse.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roll for patent law: 18</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jean-Luc remembers from his case-law studies Kelleher vs. The Helbland Guild, (and JL's interpretation, Crebbers Vs. The Hoblands Guild), which upheld a similar situation, in which a mercenary was enlisted to recover an unpatented secret recipe. Because the Guilds can&rsquo;t patent what they do, but they still manage to restrict who knows their methods by recourse to secret processes, recipes, and the like.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-luc: Well, yes, but according to Crebbers Vs. The Hoblands Guild, secrets are protected, even when not patented, so I&rsquo;m here to discover what these two know, and then we&rsquo;ll determine the appropriate course of action. I&rsquo;ll have them back unharmed, and throw in a couple bottles to boot.</li>\n<li>Dalpholph: So, Aphelia, who&rsquo;s mute, stole secret recipes?</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: I&rsquo;m saying she might be in league with this elf over there, and we&rsquo;re going to have to talk to both of them.</li>\n<li>Flick (to Aphelia): I was given to understand that Baronian was not aware of this particular emplacement. Have you led me off track, AGAIN?</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deception/Persuasion: failure</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Dalpholph: I think discussing this makes a lot of sense; I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re going to allow you to take her out of here by force.</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: Certainly I have no desire to quarrell.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drastically increasing the danger level, Aphelia plays an intractable mindworm on the flute to rick-(t)roll Flick. Jean-luc slowly and unthreateningly moves closer to Aphelia and Flick, but Dalpholph starts moving to meet him. (JL whistles faux-innocently, attempting to project the impression that 'this is all totally normal and we'll all leave nice and peace-like')</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dalpholph (in a stage whisper): Now that I think about it, you could certainly help us stand up to this elf [Flick] you&rsquo;re after, who really kind of trounced us.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: Of course! Tepplin has very little regard for brew &hellip; stealers.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Balgalaphus suddenly shoves Flick onto the ground to separate her from Aphelia. Falling, Flick invokes an unusual malediction (&ldquo;little rascals apple dumpling gang motherfuckers&rdquo;?), part of the northern Horth dialect, as Balgalaphus steps in between her and Aphelia.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Balgalaphus: What &hellip; was that? Did I hear you say apple? Is that a dig at the fact that Seomra refuses to grow apples? You must be referring to our sister tree.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick loses all sense of proportion as her butt makes contact with the ground, shouting in Abyssal, &ldquo;Come now Ravager of the Plains, as I unleash thee, so must thou unleash hell upon these fools&rdquo;, summoning into being a Bestial Spirit named Gerd. A hole opens in reality, and out steps a miniature version of Ephatha, the \"stained glass inside-out bear thing\" but quite a bit cuter and less threatening. The portal opening up causes Seomra to do what looks like recoil in horror. Flick draws her rapier while Gerd chomps into Balgalaphus, who shrieks in pain. &ldquo;What is this dark creature you&rsquo;ve summoned?? I thought you were just a recipe stealer? What does this have to do with getting the rights to make beer?&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: I &hellip; don&rsquo;t &hellip; know.</li>\n<li>Fez: I think you all understand how serious the threat to intellectual property is, now.</li>\n<li>Balgalaphus: I don&rsquo;t understand why you would come back in here to get this woman; we had no idea if or what she&rsquo;s involved in, and now you&rsquo;ve created a ruckus!</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: Yeah, I &hellip; just do what I&rsquo;m told.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"toc_3\">Ruckus</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: This much is clear: Our party brings the ruckus.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Balgalaphus: RUCKUS&hellip; GET OVER HERE!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Fez, this seems like a weird grift of the sort enacted by the pirates he spent time with in his younger days, but it&rsquo;s not going very well. He gets his eyes up over the ledge, pulls a snacking ration out of his bag, and waits to see how it turns out. When reaching into the bag Fez discovers that the popcorn is incredibly wet, and the popcorn as (inversely) dry &mdash; so it takes like he&rsquo;s sprinkling sand over algae. The popcorn has the size, shape, and consistency of cooked ravioli. Fez wonders if he ate some mushrooms? [Medicine 10] Something is weird. Fez knows how to salt and pack foodstuffs so they will be preserved, but something strange happened. Fez forgoes eatign it and whispers, &ldquo;Hey, tree, can you take care of this,&rdquo; while holding out the snacks to Seomra. Seomra takes a flower-sniff, and then retreats. A venus fly trap sticks its tongue out, spits onto the ground, and retreats back into the tree. Fez packs up the snack and puts it in his bag.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Carlos notes at least two ruckuses and, with his superior dwarven hearing (?) has heard the conversations &lsquo;downstairs.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carlos (To Drav): Do you want to go down and check it out, or do you want to stay here by this wishing tree and eat apples?&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Drav: It sounds like we might be needed downstairs.</li>\n<li>Carlos: OHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhkay, Drav.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Carlos sneaks down the stairs and sits next to Fez. Offered some popcorn, he sees nothing wrong with the soppy medallions and swallows a few handfuls. It&rsquo;s a little funky, but no weirder than some of the adderwort algae he used to eat after gathering it from the cave pools. However, it distinctly tastes unlike popcorn. But it&rsquo;s very cheesy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eaten worse!&rdquo; said Carlos, continuing to slurp.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gerd: Master, why are you letting the elphs attack me like this? (And it backs up into you like a dog doing the backwards hump jump)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick, only half-away that she&rsquo;s the reason it&rsquo;s here, doesn&rsquo;t respond.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meanwhle, Cyrowan comes down the stairs, sniffs Fez&rsquo;s pack and motions for a sample. Fez points to some of the popcorn that is on the stairs; Cyrowan has already started moving towards Carlos, snatches what&rsquo;s in his hands, then snuffles up the crumbs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">Aphelia's flute song</h2>\n<p>Aphelia plays a song on her flute. Flick and Jean-luc find themselves unable to move as they soak in the extraordinarily calming melody she&rsquo;s begun to play. The Elphs are affected a little more strongly, and all but Balgalaphus and Jerephala, are affected in the same way. Gurd: &ldquo;Master, was this you calming them all? They&rsquo;ve stopped attacking me.&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: I&rsquo;m sorry I dragged you into this.</li>\n<li>Gerd (imprinting on Flick): I&rsquo;m not. I love this intimate interaction we&rsquo;re able to have.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A muffled clomping of hooves is heard.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruckus: Ruckus is here! Was I called for? I can see that one of the nethercreatures has made its way into our sacred grove. (She fires two arrows into Gurd).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Flick: poor creature!</li>\n<li>Ruckus: don&rsquo;t declare it a poor creature! it is evil, and whoever summons it is likewise evil.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc (stage whisper): I thought maybe we could &hellip; persuade &hellip; it to be on our side.</li>\n<li>Ruckus: What&rsquo;s this about persuasion? I love to enter into dialog.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vengeance walks up and looks nervously at Gerd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a deliveryman and I have a delivery for Jean-Luc, the famous brewer? It says here you&rsquo;re &hellip; the sheriff of Brew Town? I guess that would be you, then, holding that star?&rdquo; - Jean-luc: Yep, that&rsquo;s me, total stranger to me!. - Vengeance (handing Jean-luc a bag of dead rats): Great, well I have one large order of &hellip; &lsquo;secret ingredient&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-luc has no idea what Vengeance is doing, whether it&rsquo;s a grift or a prank. Jerephala, who bears a very very passing resemblance to Lydia, makes eyes at Jean-luc, says, &ldquo;Oh, my my, a sheriff, how intriguing!&rdquo; as the other elphs tisk her.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-luc: This is hardly the time, or the place.</li>\n<li>Jerephala: Oh, very businesslike I see! That&rsquo;s really something.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Yes, it says here on my clipboard: &ldquo;Most powerful sheriff in all the 28 kingdoms.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know why it would say that, but &hellip; he seems like a pretty big guy.</li>\n<li>Jerephala: A little bit of puffery never hurt anyone.</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: It&rsquo;s hard work being so great. Unfortunately I do have a job to do.</li>\n<li>Jerephala: Perhaps I could convince you to return when your job is done. Or is it really that urgent in the first place?</li>\n<li>Jean-luc: Of course, the Tepplin Brewery takes this sort of thing very seriously &hellip; I would love to return, but it&rsquo;s contingent on me getting out of here with my quarry.</li>\n<li>Jerephala: Oh we typically only speak of hunted animals in that way. You'd reduced people to animals, have you?</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: Anyone who would steal from the Tepplin Brewery doesn't deserve to be considered a human.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Jerephala: Quite devoted to your philosophy, I see. Oh boy. Did the tree turn a fire on? It's quite warm in here, perhaps I'll get a breath of air, would you like to accompany me?</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: I'm afraid I must stay here and apprehend these criminals.</li>\n<li>Jerephala: Your mission must not be denied!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drav walks to the stairs, over to the traffic jam. Are we fighting them? I heard something about a 'Brew Sheriff'?</p>\n<p>Carlos (eating popcorn): I'm just eating popcorn while I watch all this, with this fuzzy dog thing.</p>\n<p>Fez: This is one of the most poorly executed things I've ever seen.</p>\n<p>Flick: On a scale of 'one' to 'greased unicorn wrestling pit' ... how would you say it's going.</p>\n<p>Aphelia has to keep playing her instrument in order for \"the spell to work\" so if her concentation is broken or the flute is torn from her hands --</p>\n<p>Cyrowan shades Fez by calling him short.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc can now move.</p>\n<p>Flick: Can you knock the flute out of her hand?</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc walks over to sleight the flute away.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nat 20 on her performance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aphelia manages to turn away from him and dance back into the nestle of hedge elves, playing the flute the while.</p>\n<p>Drav gets a few pieces of algae-popcorn from Carlos; the a couple of pieces catch in her throat, and all of a sudden she hears Eldar, \"Don't worry Drav, even tho we haven't unified yet I can still do my best to protect you.\" And Eldar breaks down the poison and her nausea subsides.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav now has \"The Protection of Eldar,\" which lets her wear heavy armor and cast Absorb Elements 3 times per LR without expending spell slots.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, Eldar!</p>\n<p>Eldar: We've been kept apart so long I have to do all I can now.</p>\n<p>Drav has a vague mental image of a dwarfling from her childhood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dalpholph shakes off the effects of the calming flute music, and tries to shoot Gerd who's nearly covered by Aphelia. \"Aphelia, can't you squat, or kneel or get out of the way?\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick tries to bring Aphelia into the Ethereal Plane after putting her arm around Aphelia's waist, then, in the Plane, snatches the flute out of her hand, and walks both of them over to the door to the outside. In this new space, she's started humming to herself that same deep repetitive note she'd been humming to herself before, to communicate some of the moments she was taken from Calliope, and she might be regressing to that state. She is under distress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: Look, I'll give you back the flute, but please don't play that song again. Aphelia nods slowly.</p>\n<p>Flick: You're gonna feel a bit of a pull as we come back into the material plane. Can you just walk right out the door and wait for us outside without drawing attention to yourself? Aphelia reaches for the flute, which Flick returns to her, and she worrisomely begins to play the deep not, but then gets a little jaunty with it towards the end. They step out of the EP and she fires her longbow at Balgalaphus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ruckus: The one we thought was our kind is using a twisted version of The Misty Step. She cannot be trusted, even tho she may look like us! Seomra, stop this one!</p>\n<p>Flick shoots at Balgalaphus and hits with the second arrow which passes through her femoral artery and begins to bleed out, falling unconscious.</p>\n<p>Flick takes out another arrow. \"I don't want to hurt the innocent people who work here.</p>\n<p>Ruckus: Why did you hurt even one?</p>\n<p>Flick: She started it!</p>\n<p>Ruckus: She did not attack you, she went after this creepy beast.</p>\n<p>Flick: She shoved me down! and got between me and my lady friend here.</p>\n<p>Ruckus: I thought I heard you talking about wrestling. It seemed like you would like a bit of the old \"push and shove\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: I'll keep my distance if it's all the same to you. If the rest of these good elph kind would keep their distance they would find it much to their benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ruckus: I certainly don't see how a shove is equivalent to shooting arrows at a person.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: Balgalaphus found someone she thought she could push around&nbsp;</p>\n<p>jerephala: Oh, sheriff, what do you have to say about the dying hedge elf? Balgalaphus is one of my greatest friends here! I'm absolutely devastated.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: I don't uh ... have jurisdiction over that sort of thing. I'm only empowered to deal with crimes against the brewery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jerephala: You said specifically you were going to put the hedge elf in chains.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: yes, but only for stealing the secret recipe. the murder is up to the local authorities.</p>\n<p>Flick: Murder? It was self-defense! It was obviously self-defense, \"SHERIFF.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Look, I'll testify if I'm subpoenaed: we have very strict non-disclosure agreements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jeraphala: A true sheriff would go after a murderer</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Again , I have no jurisdiction over capital crimes, only brewery business.</p>\n<p>Jeraphala: And what is that jurisdiction? What does that allow you to do?</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Mainly to arrest people who have committed crimes against the brewery.</p>\n<p>Fez: It's like a bounty hunter but with limited power.</p>\n<p>Flick: So what will it be, Ruckus?</p>\n<p>Ruckus: As far as a duel?</p>\n<p>Flick: I'm not proposing a duel, I'm just suggesting that you allow these people in way over their head to fuck off, and you can attempt to see order as you see fit. I'm also right by the door, so you can walk right off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gerd breaks out of the calmness and has bounceback rage. \"What are you doing all the way over there now, Master?\" It closes with Dalpholph and attacks with advantage. \"Is this right, master\"</p>\n<p>Ruckus: This creature seems to have attacked with an extra fury. I know this to be possible only when it is near an ally. I must now suspect that you and this sheriff are working together!</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: I'm definitely not working with this filthy recipe stealer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ruckus: I know that none of my Elph kin would ever give house to this beast, this Creepazoid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: How sure can you be?</p>\n<p>Ruckus: We have limited emotional telepathy. I can be nearly 100% sure, except we don't believe in percentages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc refuses to respond to that. \"Is it possible that you're mistaken about reading the beast's intentions. I am no ally of any of these people.\"</p>\n<p>Ruckus: Yet the beast considers you to be an ally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: You'll have to take that up with him.</p>\n<p>Ruckus: Gladly, and as a sheriff you should bring him over to me, in chains. Go on! Show me your handcuffs! Prove you're a sheriff!</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Of course I'll be happy to help you apprehend this creature.</p>\n<p>Flick winks.</p>\n<p>Fez: I agree with the flute player. Can we all just stop accusing each other so we can bring the brew thieves to justice.</p>"}

Sporting long blonde hair and a seven-day shadown, and swatched in a black cape and thoroughly embuckled leather armor, he's by no means hard on the eyes. Shaken by a recent vision of a ravenous wolf god abomination, he slides into the group's slipstream. Perhaps feeling bound to prove himself, he immediately offers to participate in a naked oil wrestling tournament hosted by some gaudily dressed boggles taking place inside an abandoned lavarock worm dung circle.</p>\n<p>Before long, the atmosphere becomes truly uncomfortable; Exuviae Whiffinger, a unicorn, is summoned by one of the druids in order to coat the wrestlers with orange grease. A newbie to this sort of thing, Jean-Luc undergoes some psychedelisis, which makes it even harder to refuse having a cast of his genitals made. Fez, seeing another overconfident acquaintance in need, steps in and challenges druid Dealla, but refuses to wrestle unclothed. The druids gather to discuss this unprecedented request, and Drav jumps on the clustering to lay the smackdown with a fireball. Flick rushes in to extract Jean-Luc, who begins to suffer increasingly debilitating migraines the further from the circle he gets. By this point, Drav has turned into a dwarven flamethrower repeatedly frying the oily and flammable druids. Exuviae briefly assumes her ascendant form, in which she appears as a super-ripped human with an alicorn and hooves for hands. Genital moldings appear from every available tree limb as Exuviae Hit-inger crumples Fez like a tree bark pamphlet with a crushing hoof smash.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<section>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1\">\n<p>(Gnoll) lit 'warp shadow.'&nbsp;<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/7#fnref1\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</div>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p><em>notes taken while playing [is this all possible notes?]</em></p>\n<p>fez: whip, rapier, fish-scale mail</p>\n<p>drav: dwarf looked like raised by elves; long luxurious beard and hair with twigs and flowers; quarterstaff with carved-like-Tulip on the end.</p>\n<p>flowerfolk ?</p>\n<p>jean-luc: the crime syndicate that's after you lost you in marshbout, and you've been hiding out in the forest for a week trying to lose the tail.</p>\n<p>JL trying to move quickly without being detected</p>\n<p>tied a broom to the back of his belt to erase tracks, and it's making things worse (so &hellip; how is it that they haven't found him?)</p>\n<p>JL sees drav, fez, turtle from 80 feet away</p>\n<p>sees drav, super-beefy bustling wizard</p>\n<p>doesn't see flick, who's up in the trees</p>\n<p>JL: these folks are not after you - crouched low, looking \"through\" underbrush</p>\n<p>jean luc: black cape; leather with unnecessary buckles; long blonde hair; 5'o'clock shadow; in woods for a week; rapier (\"Lydia\") in cursive</p>\n<p>jean luc and fez recognize kindred spirits in being over-confident jean luc lives life to the fullest; and fez also doesn't mind</p>\n<p>dk: over-estimate own charmingness</p>\n<p>mushroom capsules made of sinews</p>\n<p>attacked by dog made partly of plant growth; dispatched it but it knocked him down and briefly passed out and had a vision of huge john-carpenter wolf merged with the thing ravaging an area, ripping heads off bodies; raging out of control; pure cannibalistic hunger and violence (Shogal).</p>\n<p>mick: tell me your views on life cycles and fungus</p>\n<p>jean-luc: lying; you sleep with the wrong guy's wife.

He recognizes this as standard thieves communication, albeit slightly more sinister than necessary. Checking the room to confirm that nothing else has been disturbed, he walks over and investigates the dagger. It looks like an arsenical-bronze blade, and individual strips of rawhide dyed blue, green, and white are tied around the hilt to form a grip. On the obverse is a drawing of the city with a particular house marked with an X. The reverse contains a note in bold calligraphy:&nbsp; \"Twilight. Bring the dagger.\" Jean-Luc surmises this note is an instruction from the Hat Baskets (aka the Priest Ground Bag) regarding where and when to meet. Seeing he's in no rush, he lazily enjoys smells of roasting meats, fresh bread, and tangy ale wafting up from the kitchen, set to further delight by comparison with the clean bay breeze and the distant mewing of gulls.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance, chary of the company such environs have no doubt attracted, says to himself, \"I hope they don't expect us to make chitchat with the others villagers here.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick in frustration examines Shoemaker's goodberries, beginning to wrinkle and shrink from waterloss.

One of the chefs, a tall willowy woman with short-cropped brown hair, cautions, \"You know you can't make fires in your room.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: \"All I want to do is cook these berries on your stove for an hour or two and seal them in a jar in some boiling water.\" The chef looks at Flick like she needs to get over herself. \"i have to prepare for the guests all day long. i guess -- there's a little room on the hearth -- if you wanna grab a cast iron pot, you can take one, but don't get in the way of anyone.\"</div>\n<div>Flick: \"i'm uhhhhhh pretty good at not getting in the way.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick ends up with a jam ...</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>20 hit points worth</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>... though she's not planning on spreading it on toast. Nevertheless,&nbsp;Vengeance tries to procure a toasted baguette to spread it on (after Flick gives him a little bit). \"Oh nice! continental breads!\" and he stuffs his pockets full of them. There are no baguettes, though. Mostly pumpernickles and dense black and brown breads. the seeds are pretty well crushed. there are finer loaves. His desire for a smooth bread experience is matched pretty closely. He usually dips his bread in water, which is why dipping nuts in them is even worse. He also has a 'bread cup' to pour water into, which mostly drains out the sides and then he eats the soggy bread. \"Everything I own is actually made out of bread,\" he mourns.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A little kid decked out in a beanie and a onesie emerges from the kitchen.&nbsp; \"Hey can i get you some bread?\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: \"ooh, i don't know if i like this. I think I found what i was looking for.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>kid: you seem to really be picking through them. people around here don't have great hygiene. i have to wash my hands before each meal.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The DM thinks that \"maybe\" this is for religious rather than germ-theory reasons, which would make sense. Luckily, no one calls him on it.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: \"you mean other people have access to this bread? i thought it was just for me,\" he declares, standing in the middle of a very crowded small room with two long wooden tables, six people waiting behind him to get at the bread.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: oh, i assumed they were here for other stuff. geez. josh. sorry. i'll just ve another ten minutes or so.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THE WAY, WE WANT SOME BREAD HERE. WE WANT BREAD, WE WANT BREAD. as the other guests begin to pound the tables demandingly.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: if you can even call this bread, i'm not sure. i think i'm going to take my business elsewhere.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The kid bristles. \"People around here love my mother's bread. i'm always been told you should be as nice as you can if it's a stranger you might be impugning.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: it shouldn't be so hard on me! (he takes a bit of a ceramic bowl and cracks his front tooth). \"not again!\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>the kid digs under the pile for the lightest, creamiest loaf to give to him. it's still loaf shaped. \"what's a breadstick?\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: you know what a stick is, right?</div>\n<div>kid: is it like that?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>a guy behind vengeance is holding a stick ready to smack some sense into you.</div>\n<div>vengeance: a perfect example!

(flick gives Vengeance a piece of bread and offers him the jar of goodberry jam)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>addlepated woman: each number not in a \"heave-ho\" is left as a curse through which for you to go. my prosody's not what it once was.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: so ... i'm double-cursed now?</div>\n<div>flick: sounds like.</div>\n<div>DM: sounds like you're only singly-cursed, since they didn't count up their heave-hos.</div>\n<div>vengeance: so it takes away the curse?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The DM clarifies that, in fact, each heave-ho is another curse.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: so if i'd gotten two curses it would have canceled out? uhhhhhh.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL is still in his room, enjoying the fact he got to wake up in a bed. a nice change of pace. he hears a bit of commotion downstairs. \"i don't care what this is, it's not my problem. nothing's on fire and i don't hear bloodcurdling screams.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Galen 'reminds' DK that Jean-Luc's toenails look freshly cut, since Vengeance trimmed them last night to make a necklace to ward off curses.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL didn't notice -- V has done this enough to be able to do it in people's sleep --&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>DK requests to determine whether or not the necklace would have any effect on Jean-Luc. Vengeance's arcana check is a 12.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>it's unlikely, but it's possible that it would could ward off a curse, but probably not at the expense of JL. thsi old lady's curse. but as far as you could tell she didn't have any body parts of yours, and wasn't personally afflicted by what you'd done. the curse has a tenuous hold on you anyway, even if she were powerful.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>ian: is there a kind of magic that has to do with sympathetic attraction? where you require pieces of a thing to exert control. me: absolutely. it doesn't always have a negative connotation. there are cultures where it's part of their world, and for others it's necromancy. sometimes it might be real, and sometimes it might be believed.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL heads downstairs, grabs some breakfast tea, some bread and cheese.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance was hoping not so much to absorb the curse into JL, like a voodoo doll shield of JL. Vengeance is trying to Munchausen-by-proxy Jean-Luc so that he comes to depend on Vengeance. (actually curse him and make him sick).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Externally, Flick sees Vengeance pull out a necklace of toenails string together with devilfloss. He realizes Vengeance is more occupied with this bit of charm and puts away the jam and stares awkwardly down the street.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL comes over Vengeance muttering over some toenails that might be familiar</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>(with a 20 passive investigation, he probably does know.)</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>After seeing the dagger this morning he'd probably checked over himself for tattoos, and noticed his nails had been cut -- that he knows exactly what Vengeance has done. (\"There may be a time when Vengeance has to die\")</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL doesn't believe in folk-magic of this sort, or only of the fringe centers, the way real DK thinks about astrology. (\"i think it's cool, but i don't believe in it\")</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL looks around to make sure no one's listening, now that they'lre out in public. it's pretty loud, even in the morning. there's the beach market at which also some celebration seems to be happening making a lot of noise.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL : it seems like we should wait for our friends at the Temple to take care of Fez. How do you feel in the meantime about getting involved in the local thieves' guild?</div>\n<div>Flick: YesSssssss!</div>\n<div>JL: i should warn you, -- the reason I fled Kriobolis is that the local thieves' guild put a price on my head, and these people also have a gripe with the Gaol Maidens. we might have a mutual interest then, but it's possible that they might try to kill us. i'm pretty sure they won't, but it's not out of the question.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The Demerast Saga is mentioned for the first time.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: purely out of curiosity, what was the price?</div>\n<div>JL: i'm not sure, but you're welcome to try to collect</div>\n<div>[JL is intimidating Vengeance out of being serious. Vengeance doesn't even notice that JL is trying to intimidate you. ]</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Yeah, maybe I will. Um, how are you feeling today, JL. are you feeling ... cursed at all?</div>\n<div>JL glances at the necklace and shrugs. well i slept in a bed, I had breakfast to eat, I'm in a city , and nothing is trying to kill me, so i'm better than i've been in a few days.</div>\n<div>vengeance: definitely nothing is trying to turn me into a bag of bones</div>\n<div>JL: but i should warn you that the GMs are quite capable of collecting the bounty and we shouldn't take them lightly.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL notices that as Vengeance fingers his necklace, two of the toenails fall off, being insecurely tied to the string. JL calculates that over time the necklace will disintegrate of its own accord.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>where the necklace falls in the sandy dirt of the street he sees a metallic glint. JL picks it up. it's a very simple circle and pin brooch that bears a distinctive design. creatures carved into it; something that looks like a lion, and a goat, carved delicately around the circle.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: [history]</div>\n<div>flick: is this a clue?!</div>\n<div>JL: there's a kingdom -- lowest ithsmus on the right; a kingdom that when he was learning old thieves' legends, was rumored to have been started by a group of seafaring pirates who settled down and formed coastal communities to raid the surrounding areas. over time it became an empire, which would take advantage of the agricultural people in the hinterlands. these two animals were on their crest. the empire itself is even considered to be historical by this point. he can't be sure what modern use the symbols are being put to. just by looking at the item, it looks like it was made recently to evoke that imagery of that empire (exploitative piracy).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>it looks like it's made out of sandford brass. JL puts it in his pockets.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL wants to take a day to enjoy things not trying to kill him.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>they head towards the southern harbor district. Flick follows JL, but thinks they shoould look in on Fez too. he's about 3/4 of a mile away in the direction of the harbor.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[1:22]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>On the outside it looks like Alphonse Alpothecary. they were told to go in and ask for a lotion that matches your dagger.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: wait, before you go in there, did you see the sign? (he can barely walk because he's laughing too hard, dropping ever more toenails ffrom the necklace like breadcrumbs. ) DK: you have at MOST ten toenails. IAN: you could break them smaller. DM: you might be leaving an actual trail of breadcrumbs.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL walks in, produces the dagger, and asks for a matching set. I think just a few have come in and they're going to be in the back room. he walks to the front, locks the door, and draws the blinds shut. behind the counter is a trap door with stairs leading down into a basement space.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL to himself: standard back-roo criminal fence stuff. no guy obviously standing in the shadows ?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance runs inside and says, \"I'm privileged too.</div>\n<div>JL: the archer's with me. the monk i take no responsibility for.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Alphonse: old monk, are you lost here? have you mistaken this for a place off sanctuary?</div>\n<div>vengeance: i'm hoping it will be, but i did have a question. do you happen to do custom weapons here.</div>\n<div>alphonse: we don't --- as you can see this is entirely an apothecary, we havae potions and lotions and medicaments and ointments and jointments. do you desire any of these things?</div>\n<div>vengeance: oh yes. uh.

(latvian: dārgakmens trakums)</div>\n<div>yes, let me see -- he pulls out a loupe and looks through the bag, picking out a few (pearl, some gemstones). this should make it even. i hate to deprive you of some of the most valuable, if this is your whole store.</div>\n<div>JL: then we have a deal.</div>\n<div>AL: was it tashara who sent you here, or malenka? reminda? i know she's been getting on the scene.</div>\n<div>JL: i think a man of your profession appreciates a little discretion.</div>\n<div>AL: they will miss out on the commission. they didn't provide a calling card?</div>\n<div>JL intuits nothing nefarious on the surface, but he's not positive it's just to commission them</div>\n<div>JL: nope, i jus wandered in by chance.</div>\n<div>al: seems very unlikely , esp with that dagger, and does seem like discretion is the better part of good relations.

it takes me; i do have acquaintance with this kind of material, but it takes me a while to examine its qualities.</div>\n<div>flick: dead, small creatures in a lake. we're not sure what they use them for.</div>\n<div>melford: i'm gonna have to identify these, which is an extra cost. do you even use a shield tho?</div>\n<div>vengeance: maybe i would use a shield. it's not against my religion.</div>\n<div>melford: well from what i've heard from other monks is that if they use a shield they aren't as agile as they otherwise would be. you do have those fancy goggles tho, what do you use those for.</div>\n<div>vengeance: just ... night swimming, primarily. i guess i could use them as a sleep mask.</div>\n<div>melford: they do have holes in the eyes, how would you ... ?</div>\n<div>vengeance: they're kind of falling apart, so i pull the splinters over the eye holes</div>\n<div>melford: so a collection of wood splinters that happen to be formed into a goggle shape</div>\n<div>vengeance: that's kind of a crass way to put it, but i suppose. maybe a helmet?</div>\n<div>melford: it's a little too thin, it'd have to be part of a helmet. i could stretch it into a bracelet for you, frankly. or a pendant. or you coul dwaer it that way now. you could just put a string through it. it seems like you had something specific in mind</div>\n<div>flick: it didn't help those armadillos</div>\n<div>melford: you're being careful ? those can carry leprosy. i couldn't want you bringing that into down. we're already dealing with the marsh sickness.</div>\n<div>flick: oh yeah, we saw that on our way in</div>\n<div>melford: you didn't touch any of those folk, did you? i hear they are very contagious.</div>\n<div>flick: i think we should -- i don't see any reason to stigmatize people for something not their fault. but we took the proper precautions</div>\n<div>melford: well as an ex-mountain-dwarf I have to obe careful, i don't have any innate immunities, so the further away i stay the better.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick: vengeance, what's the deal here?</div>\n<div>melford: i can make a thin choker?</div>\n<div>flick: that sounds like it ticks some of hte boxes</div>\n<div>vengeance: that would be perfect, and i should do it anyway, but i don't know if it would be effective in protecting us against whatever killed the armadillos. i think we need a full bodysuit made of this material, otherwise</div>\n<div>flick: i think what killed them was a meteorite, so</div>\n<div>vengeance: there could be another one at any second.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>melford: so these armadillos still died ... ?</div>\n<div>vengeance: i think they made the same mistake of not wearing enough</div>\n<div>melford: what gives you the notion it's protective at all</div>\n<div>vengeance: the only parts of them left were the pieces of flesh below the metal</div>\n<div>melford: what do you mean, that were left.</div>\n<div>V: iti seemed like they were bones except for what was protected ...</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[DM corrects what he described, which is that the recently killed ones had living tissue under the bracelet. ian: did cyrowan deflate? dm: cyrowan was being artificially animated, but the burrowlings were alive; it looked like their mentation had been changed somehow</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: so this would only be useful to us if we were in danger of being deflated</div>\n<div>melford: did you say fellated? do you want a cock ring?</div>\n<div>vengeance: if others try to ... deflate us ?</div>\n<div>melford: the notion of deflating is pretty alien to me; frankly if that's what these bracers do i'm not sure i'll be able to transform them</div>\n<div>flick: i'm 98% sure vengeance is wasting our time</div>\n<div>vengeance: this metal must be special in some way.</div>\n<div>melford: i can ...</div>\n<div>vengeance: no, it's pretty much useless to us</div>\n<div>melford: i have some other weird projects you might be interested in. holdon.

JL doesn't see anything overtly sinister about it. there is a kind fo back alley for horse or cart traffic that connects to the roads on either sides, and a small fenced-in area in the back. to spy on it, he'd have to get up top, or view the back rooms through the houses on the other side of the back alley.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: it seems like it would be a poor guest to spy now, and instead check in on Fez.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They avoid the guardds at the front and head directly for the infirmary. the pavillion top has expanded, and more shade is being provided to those inside. there don't appear to be more patients than there were before.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They see Odeshka but not Vaka. Fez has been moved to the other side; they're keeping open beds closer to the entrance. he's on a cot with an umbrella, a washcloth across his forehead, loose blankets and just in his underclothes.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick and vengeance [nat 1 perception] thinks his cheeks are raging with fire. Even the little vengeance knows about monastic healing tells him that Fez is probably fine.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: omg, has anyone looked in on him at all?</div>\n<div>Odeshka: our generosu donors, how are you doing today. have you come to check on yoru friend?</div>\n<div>Flick WHAT DID WE GIVE YOU</div>\n<div>JL: i gave them five gold</div>\n<div>Flick: Fez looks like he's barely going to live through the night, what's going on with him.</div>\n<div>Odeshka: no, he's been recovering miraculously. Vaka said it wasn't the marsh sickness. he's been resting and barely talking in his sleep. follow me.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>close up flick can see that he's not sweating, there's no pallor, and he's not exuding a fisih aura. every other person has dried herbs hung up around him, but they haven't had to around Fez</div>\n<div>Odeshka: he's here as an unusual patient. we give him the same level of care, but he'll recover much quicker. we don't have to fight against continual decomp. Vaka told me that the departure of his patron deity is doing the most ot hurt him. almost like his life's purpose has gone out of him, but the body is healthy.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>this is the first time Flick has heard of Fez being involved with the divine.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Odeshka: i assume you'll have to take him back to the Newemp Shire, which may be what he needs to fully recover. or a temple of his patron deity as when he was still in the colors of a paladin.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL notices that Odeshka's canines are noticeably longer than a humanoid. [nat 1 survival] JL identifies her as a sun vampire. (DM clarification: not all vampires are evil, it's a legit species). It's certainly the tannest vampire , and also has that victorian clothing look with the skirt.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL remembers seeing that child's face in the window of the temple yesterday. Another glance today bears no fruit.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance reads from his mind palace ... \"my mental files are unorganized right now, even though the monks spent so much time teaching me mnemonic tricks\". fellows, perhaps you've heard of the Manoosh? the manoosh? they are a group of Naga, and i know you probably don't know what that is, it's a human-snake race. the primary concentration center for them is the Dayama desert, in the middle of the continent. you may recall meeting them here, in this temple. \"LEXICON: \" vengeance goes into a trance and starts reciting everything he knows.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: why bring this up, vengeance?</div>\n<div>vengeance: hm, good question. it might just be helpful, in case, .... oh right, Vaka, is he here?</div>\n<div>Odeshka: I can see if I can find him inside, and appears with Vaka after a few moments.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vaka: my friends, how do you do this day? i take it you've seen the condition of Fez, recovered so quckly.</div>\n<div>Flick: our hearts are heavy that there are things your healings skills won't be able to touch, but we're grateful for all you have been able to do.</div>\n<div>Vaka: it's quite sad; a adventurers, if you could bring you any information from distant realms, i think any of it might be helpful here.</div>\n<div>Flick: well we met the creature responsible, in a radiant pool under the Xanthuc Temple near the Alldrink.</div>\n<div>Vaka: yes, we did learn about them in some of our religion classes.</div>\n<div>Flick: we were the victim of the first of many thirst traps. this Thing insinuated itself into our group; i'm a little ashamed for not doing something sooner.</div>\n<div>Vaka: Flesiksa, someone over here is talking about thirst traps, isn't tha twhat your doctorate on?</div>\n<div>Flesika: Someone talking about thirst traps?</div>\n<div>Flick: thirst traps are when various strange creatures pose as a woman from someone's past in an attempt to entice them into acting against their interests. is that what you specialize in.</div>\n<div>Flesika: oh, no, I suppose the common term is Oasis, but it goes by many different names. you see, we're from the desert and oases are a subject of much contention.</div>\n<div>flick: so when you find above-ground pools in the desert, you call them thirst traps?</div>\n<div>flesiksa: that's right because they catch you because you are thirsty.</div>\n<div>vengeance: isn't that how the giant sandworms catch their prey?</div>\n<div>flesiksa: you've seen the sandworms?</div>\n<div>vengeance: yes, i know all about the dayama desert in the middle of the continent, i might add.</div>\n<div>flesiksa: you sound like you're reciting from some sort of tome. are you sure this is a natural area of knowledge for you?</div>\n<div>vengeance: yeah, it is , but i could always stand to learn more about it.</div>\n<div>flesiksa: you know, whatever humans do in the desert. a lot of lizard export. it's a pretty low economy sort of area. geographiacl exploration, and psychological exploration of time beyond geography that lends meaning to the land itself. is that what you mean?</div>\n<div>vengeance: saying \"you do what humans do\" is an odd way to phrase it.</div>\n<div>flesiksa: you're one to talk!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>desert exports: dankana -- old sanskrit word for borax(borax)</div>\n<div>- a flux for soldering and in the refining of metals and assaying of ores.</div>\n<div>- in pottery glazes</div>\n<div>- heat-resistant base</div>\n<div>- preservative?</div>\n<div>- mild base, so combat acidity</div>\n<div>salt, salts,</div>\n<div>certain animal pelts</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>vengeance: that's just the way i speak.</div>\n<div>flesiksa: your companions are humans, and they speak much more normally</div>\n<div>vengeance: i wondered if you knew anything about creatures called the Naga</div>\n<div>flick: these naga, do they have to eat people, vengeance?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>on \"naga\", the three naga all react as though they weren't expecting that to be said.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flesiksa: the naga, yes, they are a mythological race, like centraurs, quite handsome, i'm told, they were in the myths, and thirst traps themselves, if i were to use your meaning of the phrase.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick now notices that the skirt extends in a kind of short train. under the pretext of taking another look at fez, she walks right behind flesiksa and steps on her tail. she feels that she makes contact with the tip of her tail. as she does so, she hears flesiksa hiss. the tail must be curled up under them compactly, at least while people are here. they are making an effort.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>hhhhhhhh ... you gotta watch that ... are you trying to flat-tire me? please be more careful, these tdresses take quite a while to weave.</div>\n<div>vengeance: we're not trying to step on any toes here. just hypothetically, if this were a ... Naga temple, would it be a temple to the god of Arogya, or Kastari, the god of the forge and the kiln.</div>\n<div>flesiksa: well it's called the temple of kashtara, so ...</div>\n<div>vengeance: i guess it was the \"h\"</div>\n<div>flesiksa: some of those here have trouble with their \"s\"s</div>\n<div>vengeance: which one?</div>\n<div>flesiksa: well how versed are you in religious iconography?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>...</div>\n<div>like Vaka told you, we're making renovations inside. this is just a temple we found. quite sturdy, too.</div>\n<div>we weren't the ones who carved the double-helix. but if that's on there, the temple is to that god.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick: do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're snake-people in the midst of a human town?</div>\n<div>f: do i find it hard to hide that there _are_ snake people?</div>\n<div>flick: it's none of our business at the end of the day, but we would appreciate honesty, with our friend in your care , and what your _game_ is.</div>\n<div>[intimidation nat 20]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flesiksa looks a bit cowed. yes, our illusion here is not meant to be closely scrutinized. we primarmily receive those who can barely perceive the world around them. please, don't reveal our secreet. for some reason, the story that this is an old temple we found seems to carry water.</div>\n<div>flick: we don't want to make trouble. all we want to know is if we should be trusting you, and what you ahve to gain from taking in the sick folk.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vaka, in hearing range, comes over and puts a hand on flesiksa's side, \"it's ok, i've already told the unseemly monk what we are. his ventures into the city haven't resulted in any adverse press, so this is fully within what i've allowed</div>\n<div>Flesiksa: we want nothing more than to rehabilitate these creatures. it's just that ... this marsh sickness is unusual for us, coming from the desert, but what led us to take it on is that somehow the process they are going through mirrors that of the mummification rituals which the dead go through in our culture.</div>\n<div>flick: what brought you to this ... and please don't take this the wrong way ... so you're a bunch of sand-dwelling snake people</div>\n<div>vengeance: the manush.</div>\n<div>fles: yes, the manush. there are many naga, and we're just one self-identifying group</div>\n<div>flick: you're teh manush, who live in the desert, and ahve come to a place literally named after soggy grassland, and are posing as purveyors of medicine for a disease whose symptoms you recognize as a kind of mummification</div>\n<div>fles: well, this town is \"Sandford\" -- originally this was a Manush stronghold, it was one of the outposts of the empire when the desert extended here. the sandstone still exists, and you can see that the temple still stands.</div>\n<div>flick: this whole area used to be desert?</div>\n<div>fles: yes, it did.</div>\n<div>flick looks at the wall segments.</div>\n<div>fles: those walls are from after the desert reverted to decisuous land. no, those are build of fired brick and limestones or granite? this temple here extends at least its length again into the ground.</div>\n<div>flick: are you here to take your country back</div>\n<div>fles: that is impossible, for econolgical and religious reasons. but this is still a center of much power for us, so we maintain it that way, and when we can help the locals, we do so.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[flick calc 21] - she's telling the truth about what she said.</div>\n<div>fles: the temple is considered a bit of a curiosity ehre, and we encourage that interpretation.</div>\n<div>flick: we're glad our friend is doing well, and we have an appointment to keep. we'll bid you a fond farewell.</div>\n<div>vengeance: one last thing. i wonder if our friend could use a quick prayer to arogya.</div>\n<div>vaka: are you suggested his new patron should be arogya?</div>\n<div>vengeance: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. yes.</div>\n<div>vaka: i've never heard of such a thing.</div>\n<div>vengeance: he told me if i was ever incapacitated i could make decisions for him.</div>\n<div>flick: no he didn't.</div>\n<div>vaka: i assume you can discuss that amongst you. it wouldn't be too late to just ask him when he recovers fully. but i don't know that it's been done before. a halfling -- who isn't more trustworthy than a little halfling to be an ambassador. there's i would hope no need to say this, but you won't speak poorly of us to the town, and we will make sure your friend recovers fully.</div>\n<div>vengeance: normally i trust all snakes and serpents.</div>\n<div>vaka: please don't call us snakes</div>\n<div>vengeance: there's something about this whole situation that doesn't seem right</div>\n<div>vaka: and from what i've heard from the nurses, noone thinks you seem right, so a sort of equilibrium has been attained</div>\n<div>vengeance: it takes one to know one</div>\n<div>vaka: that's pretty redundant to what i said</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick: we're not here to break him out of prison</div>\n<div>vengeance: i was hoping to use my hawk-hatchet</div>\n<div>[for a moment, the conjunction of the idea of kashtari, teh god of the forge, and that with the idea of forging individualized magic weapons, occurs to you, but then disappears]</div>\n<div>vengeance: darn. you know ... when ...</div>\n<div>flick: it'll come back to you.</div>\n<div>vengeance: fine, if you just want to sleep and die!</div>\n<div>vengeance sinks down next to fez's cot and clasps his hands in his. dont worry little bud, we're going to get you out of here.</div>\n<div>[religion check] as vengeance is grasping fez's hands, suddenly a brilliant voice and apiercing white light appears.

Simultaneously, a @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{nighthunter} named @JournalEntry[gHHplCVR1XCIatu8]{Baba Jezda}, having been roused by the breaking of the seals restraining Domonkos, manifests in the tunnel and fights the vampire; during the fight, a wild blow collapses one of the walls, opening up a passage to a parallel tunnel in which flows a slow black stream. Flick, shaking off a brief fantasy of running free, fast, and undetected forever, inquires of the two titans whatever is amiss between them, and is consequently the first to witness Mogh&rsquo;s unexpected emergence from Domonkos&rsquo;s back. The party splits their attention between Zarachiel and the squiddybacking Mogh, and are soon joined by a quartet of gnomes led by one @JournalEntry[TcCRE3JgynkOYF9m]{Polive Pittlans}, a @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{confectiergamist} collecting some of the sweetest sap she&rsquo;d ever tasted tongue-wise. In a move as characteristic as it is unexpected, Carlos mends the wounded wood and with Polive&rsquo;s blessing returns Zarachiel whence she came. To help with the party&rsquo;s other front, Polive offered to retrieve a blue dragon wyrmling named Nexnag that she and the other gnomes had nursed from egghood. Domonkos renders Nexnag superfluous after banishing Baba Jezda, but not before the nighthunter barricaded the way forward by creating a rock wall and marking it with an arcane rune. A lively discussion ensues between the gnomes, the party, and Domonkos as all decide where to head next, during which colloquy Polive offers Joan a cool bit of body mod for her @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{nesethirls}, Rihhilt praises Carlos&rsquo;s pacific tactics, Foldulf heals Wu&rsquo;un^ without magic and scrutinizes Fez&rsquo;s administrations, and Paros foresees an evil end in Nexnag&rsquo;s future.</p>\n<hr />\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-be91837e-7fff-865a-f181-2c25b9a4a90f\"></span></p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Wu'un. </strong>McClintock employs the unusual spelling \"Wu'un;\" the standard form 'Woon' is far more likely to be seen nowadays.</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><hr /></div>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Transcript</h2>\n<p>[n/a]</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>[0-30]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[30]</p>\n<p>plot summary of session 007</p>\n<p>[40] rolling initiative</p>\n<p>[45] actually establishing order</p>\n<p>flick strings the bow</p>\n<p>{19} zarachiel would be amenable to talking</p>\n<p>slice out of the pole that you got the gravity orb from when carlos attacked it with his handaxe&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;oh yeah, that thing, sorry about that. what do you want. how can we make it up to you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[48] interacting with Zarachiel</p>\n<p>&ldquo;my interest is in&nbsp;

She might want to take him to town; Jean-Luc would love to visit a city in order to feel a soft pillow once again. What if we tell the rest of the party to make for the peak, and we'll be back as soon as we can. For now we're taking a skeleton crew to see if Fez can be saved. And Flick will confer with Startrella. \"Would it be possible to dial this starmote of yours to your specific location?\"</p>\n<h2>Brand: Destination</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Startrella: I don't know if I can spontaneously teleport someone to me?</li>\n<li>Flick: Well I'd be one the one casting teleportation circle. So dialing in a permanent circle is one thing, but could I get to your location.</li>\n<li>Startrella: So like a moving destination &hellip; I think I could set up something like that. I'd have to give you the sigils and the arrangement of the runestones and the starmotes, but we could rig something up.</li>\n<li>Flick: Write it on my forearm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Startrella reaches out and burns the images into Flick's palm. \"I think it's kindof like a once-and-done thing, where we have to abandon it after the first use, since someone could come across it if they're trying to get in from the Nine Hells or the Astral Plane or something, but it should be good the first time we use it. We don't want to get circle-bombed.\" \"Oh, like someone jacking in and drawing a dick onto your mule and then jacking out,\" asks Flick. \"Yeah, if the dick is like 400 million devils released onto your place, exactly, yeah,\" says Startrella.</p>\n<h2>To Sandford</h2>\n<p>So Flick, Fez, Jean-Luc, and Cyrowan head for Sandford, and the others for Goblinsmite Peak. Flick, still feeling quite nauseated, makes sure to keep her distance from Fez. Flick doesn't have any reason to distrust Fez, but Cyrowan is all over him like a cheap suit, so is brooding and waiting for when Jean-Luc and she can be at least fifteen feet away.</p>\n<h2>Ratfolk</h2>\n<p>Flick detects some rustling over near some scrub and bare trees. She sees two humanoids the size of Fez, with rodentlike faces. They have dark-brown hair, cute rounded ears and reddish-green eyes. (Fez is uniquely abled when it comes to shades of blue, which allow him to differentiate between areas of water. - Although lately within the last few days he's found himself less able to distinguish between shades of blue, ever since emerging from under the Xanthuc Temples. Fez assumes the sky has just changed; it's the same feeling you get when you come up from under decks.) Flick is sure that these are ratfolk. There are two of them looking towards the space where another must be. She starts to make a slow arc around the rest of the scrub.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, unalerted to the danger by Flick, who's just wandered around sneakily, continues to hang out. Fez continues to try to determine why his companions smell so bad, and tries to come up with the friendliest way to tell them (they probably already know). Cyrowan is always sticking his finger into himself and smelling it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyrowan: Master Fez, there are quite a few herbs around here from which we could create a rub or poltice in order to mitigate some of the odor coming from you. I've been getting some complaints from Joan and her sensitive lizard nose.</li>\n<li>Fez: You've clearly mismanaged some of your pronouns there, but if you need to collect some herbs to mitigate the stink then you're welcome to.</li>\n<li>Cyrowan: Well thank you for your permission, sir. (And moves off into the clump of trees to the north).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick has circled around without seeing any more ratfolk. She makes a beeline over to Fez and Jean-Luc when Cyrowan disappears. \"I don't think your squire's entirely on the level.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: Yes, he does have a bit of a limp. I assume it's some sort of problem for which he needs orthopedic inserts. Folk of his constitutional frailty often do.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: I mean this in the nicest possible way. You're not that great, and anyone that eager to serve has an agenda.</li>\n<li>Fez: Flick, are you going to take that?</li>\n<li>Flick: He's not wrong, Fez.</li>\n<li>Fez: Am I out of touch? No, it is my companions who are wrong. I don't think that he's eager to serve -- he's eager to <em>learn</em>. I may not be <em>the</em> greatest, but I am <em>a</em> greatest. I'm an A+ the greatest.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: your relative greatness is not the issue here. He doesn't smell great and I mean that in both senses of the word.</li>\n<li>Fez: I have noticed the smell, and I didn't want to bring this up, but I believe some of it may have rubbed off on you.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: well we were in a saddlebag together.</li>\n<li>Flick: Have you really not noticed, Fez, that since he's been along with us, the inner light that shines out and gives you your power has started dimming, almost like you've been forsaken or laid aside.</li>\n<li>Fez: But as the tide ebbs and flows, so do all things in life.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: just for a second, is it not possible that what we're saying has merit.</li>\n<li>Fez: Oh it's certainly possible, but I think it's less likely since we're not saying it.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: can we proceed for a moment as though we're right, and, if we aren't we'll happily eat crow.</li>\n<li>Fez: Everyone needs a time to shine, so I will let you explore your failures as a learning experience; so too my squire is learning to explore his own failures.</li>\n<li>Flick: that's great, we'll take it.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fez is, meta-speak, feeling under a single level of exhaustion. Pass Without Trace, shrouding them in a veil of silence, mutes the only conversational tone of the discussion. (Fez is at a \"everybody needs to hear this\" voice.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>... and Vengeance</h2>\n<p>At this moment, Vengeance (daydreaming about being passed out drunk in Stato's Den), shouting \"Wait for me!\", walks sloppily up to them with Mule by his side. Simultaneously, Cyrowan, being held at knifepoint, is pushed out of the brush by a \"human\". Flick whispers : \"this human doesn't know how little of a bargaining chip he has.\" Fez, \"Right on cue, a squire learning of failures.\" Jean-Luc, \"Certainly if he's a decent squire he can get himself out of that scrape.\"</p>\n<h2>Cyrowan Captured in a Sacred Grove</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jiffutch: Has your squire here been misplaced?</li>\n<li>Fez: Yes, he's been mis-placed, among many other misses</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: He was intruding upon sacred plants in our grove, and that will not be tolerated. We are protectors of this forest here.</li>\n<li>Fez: I'm quite sorry; were the plants clearly marked as sacred with appropriate signage?</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: From what realm do you hail that signage is required to recognize a sacred area?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All Flick can tell is that he's humanoid; he's dressed more like an adventurer: he has on leather armor, a tunic, leather gloves, and tight-fitting pants. He doesn't have any gear on him. \"Probably from some brigand's camp,\" thinks Flick.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: No, most civilized areas <em>do</em> mark their sacred sites. Cities, Hobbittons, pretty much the whole thing is covered in signage.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: It does help in avoiding these kinds of misunderstandings.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Did you say he was 'traipsing'? That doesn't really sound like him: he's not a traipser.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Yes, I was being generous there. He was mincing and squating in very undecorous ways. Ugly is another way of putting the manner in which he was moving around the area.</li>\n<li>Cyrowan: Lord Fez, don't worry, I'll protect you from the sharp pointy end of this man's rapier.</li>\n<li>Fez: Yes, young squire, you're doing fantastic.</li>\n<li>Cyrowan: Luckily he's got it at the base of my spine. But I can see how for Lord Fez everything seems to be \"the neck\" insofar as it's above your eye-line.</li>\n<li>Fez: Well, druid? If you could please move your knife away from the behind of my squire, about a foot forward or so.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: You claim responsibility for this wet musty man?</li>\n<li>Fez: In some ways, yes.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Note I didn't say 'lusty'. I hope you didn't mishear that.</li>\n<li>Fez: I diiiiid, and I'm quite confused.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: I can't attest to his lustiness, only the way in which he smells of mildew, although, it doesn't appear to emanate from him, but one he has spent much time around.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fez looks knowingly at Flick, and then Jean-Luc. \"This is what I was talking about before!\" \"This is what we get for not being in places with showers,\" replies Jean-Luc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: Anyway, he means you no harm. He was merely looking for plants to \"quench his stench\" as they say.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At that, Cyrowan attempts to make a break for Fez and slips on some wet grass, going face-first into the ground.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: Thank you for prostrating yourself, as is required of a squire.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Truly I have no quarrel with him as a person, but he's invaded our sacred realm, and restitution must be made. [Prf-n.20] Your methods for commanding obeisance from your servants baffles me, but if this is how you do it, so be it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jiffutch takes a step back and prods Cyrowan forward with his sword. Flick adopts <em>b&uacute;inn</em> [^b&uacute;inn], \"Look you put me in a funny position because I'm kindof on Team Nobody here, but what I don't like is the idea of having to give you something just because you said these trees and shit belong to you. So how about our restitution is that you fuck right off and we go back to going about our business.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jiffutch: Did you say, Team Nobodaddy? One of the Great Gods of the Blay Kessons?</li>\n<li>Flick: Nope.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Well, you also told me to fuck off, and I will not do that, this is our Sacred Grove back here, and you should be the ones to fuck off.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: Uh - whoever does the fucking off, and either is fine with me, I think it's good if we go our separate ways.</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: If you're able to wrangle your rangy friend here &hellip;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick turns back to Jean-Luc and Fez, \"Are we 100% sure we shouldn't just give him to them?\" Fez, \"Of course not. And please don't kill this poor man.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch: I have no desire to hang around this odorful young man.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc (whispers): we <em>have</em> killed people for less offense.</p>\n<p>[Jean-Luc n.20] Remembers Jiffutch from Cressida. There were a few posters; they never met in person. He's another assassin; one of them viewed themselves in competition. There were a certain number of rumors that circulated about him: he could change form, or hide in the sewers capably (could disappear into the sewers). He killed the Archduke Belsavius when they were visiting Cressida; the Archduke holds their court in a different area of the country.</p>\n<p>Jiffutch is not stepping forward into the grove; he's either trying to avoid getting involved &hellip; he probably doesn't want to pursue this any further than he has to. (The Pumpkin Prince is a persona that Jean-Luc had adopted to infiltrate royal courts; you heard it here first, folks). Jiffutch does not recognize Jean-Luc, who keeps the information to himself for the moment. \"It's in our mutual interest if we go our separate ways.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch: \"Yes, I think that's the best choice here. Even tho there's no signage\" and he throws a look at Fez, \"the grove is clearly adumbrated by the well-delineated difference between heavy forest and low grass. Make sure you ignore this weird little winding curve of the path close to myself, and be on your way!\"</p>\n<p>He attempts to blend into the forest, interrupted by Jean-Luc's question, \"We are quite a long way from Cressida. What brings you out here?\" Jiffutch, \"As I've said, I'm one of a group of forresting men who protect these trees from intruders. I -- we --- we're still attempting to grapple with the notions of pure democracy and communalism, so my pronouns may slip from time to time, but have no doubts that I have no connection with any urbanites.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"I think the Archduke would beg to differ.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch: \"The Archduke. bastard if I ever &hellip; heard of a title. None of us need Archdukes, let alone masters, or lords, or vassals.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: \"No argument here. Why don't you drop the act, and tell us what you're doing out here.\" Flick goes to double the intimidation, but Jean-Luc gives her the \"tone it down\" sign. Immediately, his clothes shift and warble, and he grows in bulk to the point where his legs are little protrusions, and his body is a thick column of hairy muscle. His hands turn into claws and his face elongates. He's a ratman. a were-rat. \"You want me to drop the act, fine. But your charge gets it.\"</p>\n<p>Flick turns and looks south to where she saw the other ratfolk, and hears them rustling after Jiffutch calls out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Initiative]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile Vengeance has been picking the sacred plants and creating a tiara for himself, crating it into a mitre and subconsciously emulating the wardrobe of the Archbishop which, for a monk, would typically be considered blasphemous. (The tiara mafia!)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM apologizes for missing that Galen said Vengeance was picking the sacred plants here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Look at me, I'm the Pope, what a fool I am! In my stupid hat!\"</li>\n<li>\"Don't you mean the Archbishop?\" Vengeance considers this journey with himself.</li>\n<li>Yes, the Archbishop -- more like the Arch Buffoon!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick wonders at Vengeance's ability to always be in 'his own encounter' despite the success of his attacks. Fez remembers tales of 4-dimensional beings told to him while playing checkers, and wonders if this is what Vengeance is engaged in. Mule looks upset but reins it in and controls herself, but it seems like she's somewhat sensitive to the herbs chosen. Vengeance knows exactly what she's allergic to, which is seafood and carrots after conducting an allergy test with rusty bits of metal. Vengeance picks a few of the offending ones and puts them in his pack should Mule get out of hand later.</p>\n<h2>Jiffutch rages out</h2>\n<p>Jiffutch attacks Cyrowan, biting him in the neck</p>\n<p>Flick: \"Gents, it does occur to me that Cyrowan might be necessary to undo what is afflicting Fez, it occurs to me the possibility that it's not his mere presence but a curse or geas [^geas].\" \"I don't like being ordered around by this asshole, so I'll save Cyrowan just to spite him,\" adds jean-Luc. \"I like it! and I'll take care of these fuckers in the bushes back here,\" says Flick.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, unexpectedly hardy, is simultaneously bitten and stabbed. Little spouts of poison, coating the sword, overflow from Cyrowan's wounds. \"Master Fez, this feels like something Vengeance might do to himself while we're not watching. I think the faster you can get over here so I can learn from you, the better.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: You seem to be learning quite well yourself but I will come aid you as requested.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flick sends her \"extra-planar probe\" to sharpshoot one of the rustling shapes, sending a bolt of force damage into its mortal flesh and liquefying the organs, the pressure forcing the roiling contents explosively out of the ruptured skin.</p>\n<p>\"Cease! Cease!\" they hear from one of the surviving ratfolk. \"Stay where you are and it won't happen again,\" Flick says, slinking to an advantageous angle on Jiffutch's position. Still in a bloodlust, the @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{musthrope} puts his foot on Cyrowan's neck, turns around to look at you, and sheaths his sword, shouting, \"Leave! Leave those folk alone. Do not implicate them in the horrific attacks you clearly wish to direct against me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Didn't you start this?\" Fez asks. \"I did!\" he replies, \"but I had no idea how much power skulked within your wan and unmighty human bodies.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fez: We're not human!--</li>\n<li>Flick: Fuck around and find out, buddy</li>\n<li>Jiffutch: Yes, the full truth of that ultimatum is becoming apparent to me. I truly have never before had to concern myself with a beleagured retinue of dispossessed who, in their time of need, name me leader. It truly is devastating, to witness the death of one's @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{liegerat}.</li>\n<li>Flick: So will you take us up on that final offer?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jiffutch helps Cyrowan to his feet: \"Here's your foul-smelling friend, although with my olfactory bulbs, I'm able to determine that the smell does not originate from him but rather the halfling here.\" He points clearly to Fez, who assumes him to be pointing at the third ratfolk.</p>\n<p>Fez rather pedantically and tiresomely inquires as to the ethical system which would allow one to attack those thought weaker than oneself, but the moment they are proven stronger, that person then desires peace. \"Kind of a shit-bird move, rat-man,\" Flick summarizes in her typical David Milchean way.</p>\n<p>\"It's not that you were weaker; my bloodlust got the best of me; and, as I've said, I'm not used to caring for those who can be shattered into pointilistic droplets of blood by the steady concentration of an archer. I truly &hellip; do not know how to deal with this, psychologically, \" and he shrinks into his human form. The two rats in the grove continue weeping and looking towards one another in shock and disbelief.</p>\n<p>\"I kind of feel bad,\" Flick says. \"I don't!\" Jean-Luc responds.</p>\n<p>Now that Cyrowan has been helped to his feet, he moves to Fez. \"Sir, you were able to come to my aid so effectively. Allow me to once more pledge my undying servitude, and my desire to learn at your feet all the martial arts of swordplay and courtly graces and techniques of persuasion which ultimately woo to your side those who may wish to antagonize you but ultimately prove susceptible to your noble wits.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your desire to serve is once again well-received, young one, and perhaps one day you will be as great as I am.\"</p>\n<p>\"Apologies, sir, but I'm going to &hellip; I think I left something back here.\" Cyrowan shuffles backwards out of the range of Fez's smell, motioning to Vengeance for some kind of sage smoke smudge or perfumy herb.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to have to speak about your regiment indeed,\" replies Fez. Vengeance walks over and wraps some of the sage around his neck and lights it up. \"Hieronymous, you truly are a kind companion. I don't know why you're persisting in this strange and unsolicited practice, but I will consent,\" says Cyrowan, breathing deeply of the smoke. Vengeance smells the fishy odor wafting from Fez.</p>\n<p>Flick comes over to inspect Cyrowan, but finds it incredibly difficult to concentrate on him long enough to conduct an inspection. The bite is severe, and already beginning to fester; but he has no idea if the @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{musthropy } is confounding the diagnosis. Leaning into her strengths, Flick wheels around to Jiffitch, \"Tell me what you did to him!\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch approaches: \"I regret to tell you, your squire here has been infected with myranthropy. Vengeance, @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{stomachic } he was guilted into using up some of your best @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{smudgesage}, has his mind elsewhere, but Flick and Jean-Luc notice that Jiffutch is trying to catch their eye and avoid Cyrowan's. \"Why don't you and Cyrowan get going down the road, Fez,\" Flick says. \"An excellent idea; I have many things to teach him about an encounter, such as Never To Put One's Back To A Sword. Come, Cyrowan!\" says Fez. \"Master, you know it wasn't my fault! My back was to the sky while I was bent over collecting herbs. If I must treat the sky as a sword, then truly I don't know what to do, but these are lessons I must learn.\"</p>\n<p>\"You must always be wary of The Skyward Sword; let me tell you of its greatness.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please do, this is exactly what I came for!\" and he walks away with Fez, the latter pontificating incoherently on fighting stances.</p>\n<p>Fez and Cyrowan walk by the two rats near the grove cutting back the bits of shrub on which pieces of their exploded friends still rest. Fez hears one of them say something along the lines of \"Return to the mother\" or \"give to the mother\" and \"won't be a total waste\" but they nevertheless look emotionally devastated, and this clearly isn't any sort of opportunity for them. Fez remarks to Cyrowan, \"this is one of the problems with the primitive religions.\" To which Cyrowan responds, \"What makes them primitive for you, sir?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think it's readily apparent &hellip; they talk about worshipping. How do I say this? It's a matriarchal type of worship. Most religions have moved onto the more correct patritheism,\" says Fez.</p>\n<p>\"Very good, sir. What about a kind of non-binary theology?\" asks Cyrowan.</p>\n<p>\"That's a slightly more post-modern concept. I don't know if it'll ever catch on,\" replies Fez.</p>\n<p>\"What about serpent-sexual? Maybe even squid-sexual?\" asks Cyrowan.</p>\n<p>\"My knowledge of that is a little inky,\" puns Fez.</p>\n<p>Vengeance says, \"I'm sorry about your friend there. That was a real doozy. Did he have a wife and kids, that kind of thing?\"</p>\n<p>[1:27] \"Ripper had a few friends, nobody in her domestic circle, sadly, but I know she will be missed,\" answers a rat introducing herself as Catchkey.</p>\n<p>\"Probably a pillar of the community,\" says Vengeance.</p>\n<p>\"Well, as far as pillars, I know that Jiffutch has cautioned us from setting ourselves up on pedestals. In a way we're all supposed to be role models, but also followers,\" says Catchkey, believer in Rat-ical Democ-Rat-ic ideals.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"As usual, the people we exploded end up being pretty cool dudes.\"</p>\n<p>Catchkey, \"I'm only cool because my tears are helping to quench my hot rage, a rage I may not exact upon you, which, I'm told, is the best way. If only another here understood that emotions are better suppressed than acted upon, I wouldn't feel so alone.\"</p>\n<p>Febba, the more robust of the two, looks around, but no one meets her eyes.</p>\n<p>Flick comes up beside Jiffutch, \"what did you really want to say about Cyrowan.\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch attempts a whisper. \"What do you know about this squire of yours? I've never seen a reaction to a bite, in a humanoid, quite like his.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"You don't need all the details, but he's super hinky. As a matter of fact, we're headed to Sandford <em>kind of</em> hoping to get him out of our hair? It's a work in progress. In fact, the only reason we didn't let you have your way with him is because it's possible we might need him to undo whatever fish curse has befallen our sacred warrior.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"And also I don't like you.\" Jiffutch, \"What's that there?\" Jean-Luc, \"nothing, we'll talk later.\" Jiffutch, \"Do I spy a fellow rogue?\" Jean-Luc, \"We've run in the same circles before.\" Jiffutch, \"Doubtless, I'm faster, as I can adopt a four-legged gait. Is this what you imply?\" Jean-Luc, \"Maybe, metaphorically we ran in the same circles. I was in Cressida when you assassinated the Archduke. Beat me to it, as it were.\" Jiffutch, \"Then I must appear as no less than an idol to you. Speaking of stepping on pedestals; I know I tell the smaller folk that it's something we can leave behind, but I'm glad it keeps those like us on our toes, am I right?\" Jean-Luc, \"Sure -- back to our problem with our squire 'friend'\" Jiffutch, \"Yes, now that I have revealed myself as a shapechanger, particularly of the rodentia, I can admit I spend a great deal of time in the sewers, I've met my share of huge &hellip; turtles of a juvenile age, which have mutated into large crime-fighting forms, Turtle Power, but what I wish to impart to you is that your once-paladin's squire is under the rule of some kind of icky, underwater deity. There's a feeling of &hellip; I don't know if you could tell,\" looking at Flick, \"but the wound exhibited almost a protective sludge that it exuded, against my bite, and very few know the bite of a lycanthrope or muranthrope takes effect, but I was able to see that it would not, and it's perhaps because this creature is not suceptible to that sort of magic.\" Flick, \"Are you implying that he's not even humanoid? Or that he's just been -- or that he's in thrall to some kind of pescid deity?\" Jiffutch, \"I think it's affected his physical makeup, if ever he was fully humanoid: it could be that that's merely an adopted hybrid form.\" Flick, \"This is in alignment with our gathering suspicions. So he's not actually going to turn into a were-rat, is he?\" Jiffutch, \"I don't believe so, no. But given the power of his pledge, he may acquire some of the more pernicious features, but I don't believe that fully inhabiting the body of a giant rat will ever be available to him, no.\" Flick, \"One more reason to put him down, amirite, J-L?\" Jean-Luc, \"As if we needed one.\" Flick, \"Well, not being aware of your history together, I can't help but think this meeting is slightly awkward; thanks for the help you've given us &hellip;\" Jiffutch, \"I myself am against capital punishment, so please take that into consideration when dealing with this creature.\" Jean-Luc: \"I would prefer to take my morality lessons from literally anybody else.\" Jiffutch: \"Yes, we should make up our own minds while keeping in front of us the precepts and morals which have been passed down by those who make it their profession to outline the tenants of such beliefs.\" Jiffutch: \"Catch you on the flipside --\"</p>\n<p>Flick: \"--------------------------------Dudemeisters!\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance: \"bee tee dubs, have you ever been to a place called Redwall, in Mossflower?\"</p>\n<p>Jiffutch begins to daydream and pontificate, \"Oh the beautiful red &hellip; stone&hellip; walls of Redwall, in their &hellip; carved &hellip; stone &hellip; shapes!\" as he retreats back into the grove. Vengeance can tell he has no idea what he's talking about.</p>\n<p>Catchkey and the other have placed the straw into bundles and move to catch up with Jiffutch.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"There were always rumors that Jiffutch used the sewers to move so quickly about the city, but I have no idea what he's doing here.\" Jean-Luc has no idea if this is an act or part of a job, if he's ingratiating himself to the rat people as part of a job, or if he really did find some sort of inner peace. It's probably not the inner peace one, though. I have to believe that, whatever nefarious plans he may have, they do not involve us.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"The fact that a court assassin from Cressida is in this neck of the woods tells us that whatever settlement we show up at is going to be kindof a shit show.\" Jean-Luc, \"Yes, it usually is.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"It was weird how quickly they panicked, too, but that might have been a sincere reaction.\" Fez, even at his distance, smells a rat. \"It is concerning that he seemed to care about it,\" says Jean-Luc. \"He obviously needs them for some reason,\" suggests Fez. \"If you want to be cynical about it, he clearly felt he couldn't lose any more of them.\" says Flick. \"Or,\" says Jean-Luc,\" he was using it to disguise his own self-preservation.\"</p>\n<h2>Burrowlings</h2>\n<p>The group proceeds south-east a couple miles, only to hear a high-pitched whining cry, sounded pained and distressed, coming from off to the right. A humanoid animal. Flick, \"God, no more werecreatures!\" \"A little too high-pitched to be just an animal\" says Jean-Luc, \"I've never claimed to be the most moral person, but i don't want innocent things to suffer horribly.\" Jean-Luc draws his sword in case it's a trap. They see a creature about 70 feet away, in deep brush and lake weeds. The small creature is light brown and furred; it reminds them of a large prairie-dog. It looks like it would walk on two legs. It's wearing a bicep bracelet and a little satchel. It is bent over double and appears to be weeping.</p>\n<p>Flick starts traipsing through the brush and calls out \"oh fellow traveller, we mean you no harm,\"</p>\n<p>Nem, \"Who's there, who's talking? What do you want?\" Flick, \"Only to see what troubles you.\" Jean-Luc, \"We heard your cries from the road.\"</p>\n<p>This creature's eyes were clouded with tears, and when she looked up she couldn't see anything, \"I don't know if you can help&hellip;\"</p>\n<p>Flick, closing the distance, can see that there is a body in front of this creature, over which they are bowed. The cause of death cannot be determined. There is no blood, and they appear to be wearing as few clothes as the other.</p>\n<p>Vengeance recognizes these creatures from around the monastery. They were notorious for undermining the foundations by digging extensive tunnels. He even recognizes this sort of cry; if one of the burrowlings would become isolated from the rest of the pack and be unable to find its way back. The call could attract the pack, who would rescue them.</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Oh my god, guys, I hate these fucking things. You don't know how many of them I had to hit over the head; the problem is, you hit one, and another just pops up in their place. They're disgusting. I hate them.\"</p>\n<p>Fez, \"That reminds me of a childhood game we used to play, whack-a-gnoll.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"Ironically, since gnolls are not burrowing creatures.\"</p>\n<p>Fez, \"Yeah, it was real messed up and racist\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"It sounds like you were assassinating them.\"</p>\n<p>Fez, \"I'm not proud of it, ok. It was a different time, then.\"</p>\n<p>As Vengeance and Fez recount the ways in which they would kill humanoids, \"I can't find the rest of our burrow; I can't drag my friend back there and also find my way. Perhaps you can help?\" says the burrowling.</p>\n<p>Flick and Jean-Luc's knowledge of the creatures is simlar to Vengeance's. Since they aren't as tied to the preservation of large stone buildings, they don't care if the ground has holes. Perhaps Jean-Luc knows of some who were taken in by the ratfolk in the cities almost like orphans or refugees, and used as scouts. They feel comfortable under the ground or living in the interstitial parts of houses. For the most part though you would know them as farmers who brought goods into the city to sell, or, for Flick, as farmers. Flick's parents would complain about burrowlings whose holes would cause the occasional broken ankle for a farmhand, but wouldn't pose a danger to the crops.</p>\n<p>Flick, \"First of all, I'm sorry for your loss, no one deserves to go through that. How did your companion meet their sad fate?\"</p>\n<p>Nem: \"We were just at the water to refresh ourselves, and it'd been a long journey here, but then she was grabbed by some kind of creature, and all I could do was bring her back out, and I couldn't resuscitate her.\"</p>\n<p>Flick moves away from the bank, and activates her Primeval Awareness for Monstrosities and Fiends (her favored enemies). Flick doesn't detect either of those within (5) miles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Which may not be entirely accurate at the greater limits &hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance, \"What did this creature look like?\"</p>\n<p>Nem: \"It was mostly under water; it didn't really poke its head out. It was a blue, humanoid, seemed &hellip;\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"I think that your friend was a little clumsy and drowned herself. Should we be on our way?\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"Ignore him. We're sorry for your loss. He's not used to life outside the monastery.\"</p>\n<p>Nem: \"Oh, he lives in a monastery? I guess I can relate to that &hellip; the burrow at times can feel kind of constraining.\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"No. I never felt constrained\"</p>\n<p>Nem: What was your experience there like?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Whatever it was, it was completely the opposite of yours, ok. WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE FRIENDS. Let me just nip this in the bud.</p>\n<p>Nem: We certainly have far different levels of hair coverage over our bodies.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: You haven't even complimented my hat.</p>\n<p>Nem: Oh, is that a hat? I thought it was a strange growth.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Oh, that's a benign cyst.</p>\n<p>Nem: Which side is the hat on?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: It's cocked &hellip; rakishly &hellip; to the right? Am I still talking to you?</p>\n<p>Nem: Yes. do you wish to?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: No, I'm done here. Why are we talking to this beast. Does anybody care about this?</p>\n<p>Flick: It's no beast, Vengeance. We're rendering the same aid we would expect from any other honest traveller on the road.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: And let's be honest, we do our share of harm in the world; this feels only right that we try to put some aid out as well.</p>\n<p>Flick: If you're not wearing a tiara you have nothing to fear from us.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Well I'm not the one who exploded somebody with an arrow; my record is clean and I don't need to do any sort of penance here. You can do your good deeds, and I'm gonna be on my way.</p>\n<p>Flick: He's not wrong.</p>\n<p>Nem: It's so good to know that a community of adventurers still wears its heart on its sleeve. That everything it feels is easily &hellip; descried. I might even say &hellip; it's perfect &hellip; for this &hellip; moment.</p>\n<p>Flick draws her bow. She suddenly grows goosepimples and for the first time experiences horripilation, and goes to retreat about thirty more feet until she recognizes an eerie feeling fetting [^fetting] from that direction.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc sees the burrowling that was dead leaps up, Alive! \"The Samaritan Snare is what we call it in the trade.\" Flick turns, and for a moment experiences an alternate timeline of her life in which she fell into madness upon hearing otherworldly slurps and whispers from the back room of a tavern. This creature is a grotesque, spaghettilike, blue fleshcone, inset with hundreds of piercing red eyes, on top of pink fleshy spider legs -- the Lovecraftian version of the Lunar Lander.</p>\n<p>Fez, \"Is it called Putreosity or something.\"</p>\n<p>Gorf: the name is SOULEATER or GORF as I'm known by my friends.</p>\n<p>Fez, \"I guess you'll be Souleater to us, then.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The DM would like to indicate that yes, he is friends with Gorf.]</p>\n<p>[The real monstrosity was the friends we made along the way!]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gorf blasts Flick with a black beam of crackling energy shooting from one of its eyes. \"You've let me see your soul, and I will have it!\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"Not today, flesh rover.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"Just another weird monster that wants souls!\" The burrowling (Nem) he'd just spoken to smiles confidently and runs towards Jean-Luc. It bits into Jean-Luc's leg, but he manages to rattle its noggin with a good kick such that it can't get its claws into him.</p>\n<p>\"Submit to Gorf and this will all be over!\" screams Nem.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"I've been &hellip; I have better offers on the table.\"</p>\n<p>Nem, \"But this offer is so close and convenient. -- so be it. \"</p>\n<p>Vengeance jumps towards the burrowlings and fiddles with some oil and a flint to cast fireball. Jean-Luc slashes at Nem, but the agile creature manages to make out with a mere scratch.</p>\n<p>Nem: You see, the natural weapons are far stronger than those made by corrupted man!</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc sees, coming out of the water, his long-lost love, Lydia, with whom he had such a terrible / uneventful breakup. Flick sees an unfamiliar woman. Jean-Luc regains 6 HP, feeling energized and replenished. 'Lydia' says to Jean-Luc, \"I have been &hellip; hiding from these evil creatures in here. I tried to drown one. If you can come over and help me out of the waters, that I know that we can defeat them together and return to the city.\" Part of Jean-Luc knows that there is 0 chance that the woman he met in Cressida, the daughter of a shopkeeper, has found herself in this body of water drowning a burrowling; versus a familiar face and an offer to go back to the city.</p>\n<p>Flick: 100% this is a Rusalka, guys!</p>\n<p>Fez: Could also be a changeling.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc is vaguely suspicious. As far as he can tell, it's Lydia: he can smell a perfume of hers, the alto of her voice is spot on; the grass is parting as she moves through the grass towards him. She throws scared and frightened looks at the burrowlings. Despite his vague suspicions, he says, \"Let's defeat them together.\"</p>\n<p>Lydia, \"It's so wonderful we can be together again!\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, \"Indeed; I've always regretted our breakup\"</p>\n<p>Lydia, \"Me too, why, can you even remind me of why -- no, nevermind, all we need is this moment right now, and our shared future.\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance takes a book of matches in one hand, and oil in the other, caught in an endless process where either the matches or the oil is not in the right place at the right time. Mule has come over to lick up the applebutter oil which is what Vengeance has been using. (She's allergic to apple skins, but not applebutter made without the skins.)</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, \"Master Vengeance, do you need assistance lightning the oil?\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Yeah -- if you could just light that match , that'd be terrific.\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, \"Sometimes the hardest thing to do is a thing you've done by yourself thousands of times.\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Yes, I find that's always the case,\" and he casts fireball at Gorf. \"As a terrible person I love Ska music, but I've never been a fan of real big fish.\"</p>\n<p>Nem: Who are you talking about?</p>\n<p>Gorf gets burnt up. Some of the blue ooze comprising its upper pyramid starts to smolder, and Gorf begins to give off a pestilent aura possibly more pestilent than Fez's. The odor smells like burning play-doh. Gorf, skittering on its spider appendages, is only as fast as your typical adventurer.</p>\n<p>Vengeance, \"Anyone up for a fish fry?\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan, \"Very good, master vengeance.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, resentful towards Fliph for the embarrassing attempt at stealing the former's name without the proper mouth anatomy (\"weird malformed burrowling tongue\"), and even more resentful that she didn't get \"advantage\" against the heavily obscured ratfolk, with Fliph not having acted, she is flatfooted.</p>\n<p>K'Fliph: Actually my name is K-Fliph; I just prefer not to pronounce it because I'm so good at it.</p>\n<p>Flick moves far to the east, at the north rim of the lake, -- \"are you a rapper?\"</p>\n<p>My signature move is to K'Fliph you off.</p>\n<p>Flick sees, as the force damage from her arrow concusses K'fliph, that her skin almost gives way to an cadaverous explosion of blood, but her tough burrowling skin retains her body's flesh, and she barely surives the blast.</p>\n<p>I think now I'm just \"phhhhhhhhhhhh\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"There are still bigger fish to fry.\" Fliph, \"Bigger FLIPH to fry?\"</p>\n<p>Flick shoots a Fizzlecyst poison arrow at Gorf, missing. She then slides her shield off her shoulder and holds it in front, but she'll have to drop it to fire her bow. Confronted with the enormity of Gorf's aberrational body; Flick finds herself unable to focus on Gorf, caught in a look unable to focus. [Wisdom save 10]. She's drawn to the moment in her past? future? where she encountered a similar type of creature, and for the moment feels herself compelled to indulge in a tic. Flick had trouble with biting her fingernails, which made drawing a bow so painful, so she'd given it up.</p>\n<p>K'Fliph, at the brink of death, decides to attack Flick. Flick keeps her clawing hands at bay with her shield, but KP bites into her legs. \"Looks like once I get under your shield I can begin tearing at your flesh.\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: Master, who do you wish that I should go after? Fez: Do your best to be a distraction on behalf of Jean-Luc. His fighting style is sadly inadequate while alone; if you were to interpose yourself perhaps he could attain \"average\" effectiveness. The closer Cyrowan gets to Gorf, his body begins to ripple and turn black, almost like he's experiencing spontaneous idiopathic bruising. As this happens, he concentrates on Gorph, and the ground around Gorph explodes in tentacles in a 20ft. square.</p>\n<p>Gorph, perhaps a kindred spirit to these tentacles, rides them like a wave, as its spiderlegs massage the tentacles. \"You think one of the Old Spells can damage me? You're incredibly mistaken.\"</p>\n<p>Cyrowan's arms and feet are plunged into the earth, and look to be rising again as the tentacles. Fez, seeing this, sees the otherwordly evil emanating from every being, and sees Mule as the closest target. Mule looks at Fez, assumes the best, and comes closer and begins to nuzzle Fez. \"Roxfalannnah noooooooo!\" screams Vengeance. Fez goes \"whole hog\" at the eldritch horror. \"Fiend!\" he shouts, showing off to Cyrowan, going for a sweep the leg / tentacles.</p>\n<p>Vengeance sees Fez clearly taunting him, skipping around Mule and slashing at her fetlocks with his whip. \"Ah, that's actually pretty hot\" declares Vengeance.</p>\n<hr />\n<div>[^b&uacute;inn]: A particular ready position learned by elven rangers.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^geas]: (pr. gesh, gaysh, geesh)&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^liegerat]: Like a liegeman, but a ratfolk.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^musthropy]: Also <em>muranthropy</em> or <em>myranthropy</em>; were-mouse or were-rat-dom.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[^stomachic]: fig.

Drav @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{customs} the local post office branch to ship a frosty bottle of trollsmilk and an extensive missive to her family in Forest Ogrelodge. Fez, always perfectly in touch with his inner springwork, calls forth a steadfast steed. @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{Tregetting} for inspiration a piece of coral bestowed to him under miraculous circumstances, he attracts the attention of a sloppy clown named @JournalEntry[hTKVNYJBqitgkmEh]{Kuma} who leads him to a park pond swarming with cave turtles from which the ecologically irresponsible jape gathers a healthy supply of @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{eggrocks}. Meanwhile, Carlos, having glutted his mouth and purse with vendible candies which could have been purloined for free from the Candy Lab, gawks at @JournalEntry[AValwm9f8MXfp79x]{The Unwieldy Dolphin's} shingle and @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{forthnimms} to the desecrated former shrine to Aul&euml; being used as a social club. He attempts to preach the good word to the finger-sandwich-eating, real-estate-discussing philistines, but, unable to convert any of the nonbelievers, satisfies himself with carving a statuette of Aul&euml; into the rock wall and distributing prayer books with Drav's help. While Paros wins himself a @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{manuary} from the local villagers to free the pendulum bob from its hempen restraints and return quasi-time to the town, Flick takes a moment to recall sifting some @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{poudree} from Uugeet's pool before @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{samming up} the party and making for the surface with Domonkos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">@JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{Achieving externity} on The Grey Tongue, all but Carlos and Flick are taken unawares by two shapeless black @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{muckhumps} calling themselves Naphula and Glu&eth;er who, drawn by Drav's demon skinprint, attempts to @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{incaptivate} and dissolve the dwarven wizard. After unceremoniously roasting Glu&eth;er, the party dances around serving up Naphula in the same way until Drav can be safely extracted and Flick, amused by the ooze, can invite Naphula to confederate with them. The super-lemure having been cindered, Paros scoops some ash at the behest of Veenock and then gets some ass with Domonkos, making it to vampire-second-but-human-third?-base, all the while chaperoned by trigger-low-affect Flick. Rather than spending the night in the woods, everyone vamooses behind the vampire to the castle, making for the single lit room high in the central palace. The tricky little spellbook Drav snatched from Riult takes one last leap at manumission and inconveniently reveals their position, but it seems to matter not, as who should await them in the bedroom chamber but one calling herself Lupenna; and, as if that were not enough, she recognizes Flick!</p>"}

Vengeance considers continuing to heal Cyrowan.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick wonders what she knows about Elementals. Their intelligence is generally at the level of most beasts, but since Flick can't communicate with elementals as she can with beasts, spoken-language communication is out of the question. On the plane of water, they are animated energy. They can take shape and perform tasks when someone calls them into being on the material plane. The only ones she's ever heard of were bound into service by a powerful mage; they generally resent being bound into service, somewhat like geniis. Flick attempts to communicate with Anghala; it hovers where it is, turning the flat of its front towards Flick. The elf's primeval awareness is of no use here; she can't detect its emotions. \"It is a slightly too anti-entropic disturbance in the water\" Flick ruminates aloud. [DM describes it as a particle in quantum field theory.] It has a head-mound and pseudopod-like extensions.</div>\n<br />\n<div>The only other elementals Flick has encountered ... she wonders why it's here. Could the impact have ... ? She wonders if some kind of arcane disjunction is the reason for the explosion, and Anghala is the result. Maybe someone in Sandford will know something.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Jean-Luc: Are we sure this was caused by an impact, and not a portal-gone-wrong, or something like that?</div>\n<br />\n<div>[\"Flick only has exterior monologues.\"]</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick detects faintly a portal inchoate in her bag. As Flick touches the rope of climbing, she feels like there's some sort of portal energy about it. There's a little of the portal around Gorph's dead body, and a lot around Cyrowan.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Jean-Luc: We have a number of other pressing issues which may take precedence over The Mystery at Planghage Lake.</div>\n<br />\n<div>The group takes a short rest. Flick examines the bracers on the burrowlings arms; where they are it's preserved a thin margin of living tissue. She wraps the bracer in oilskins. Vengeance: Is there any way we can make some armor out of this stuff?</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick: If whatever created the lake is what gave this is duermer, it might point the way to what is happening. It wasn't just a meteor. It wouldn't create such a precise --- it wouldn't create that small of an impact. They'll know something at Sandford. Flick doesn't remember any astronomical phenomena from a year ago.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Because this would have been such soft ground at the time, being in the course of a river, the impact site might be larger than expected if a meteor had contacted bedrock or a hard substrate.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance collects some \"rings\" before they go to use as sexy two-finger rings one might see in a brothel.</div>\n<br />\n<div><strong>[SHORT REST]</strong></div>\n<br />\n<div>They should be able to make it to Sandford before twilight. Flick and Jean-Luc see that in the burrowling satchels it's filled up with gems and minerals. Nature check tells Jean-Luc that some of these have been passed off as fools gold, and some look genuine. THey don't look to have been collected with thyme or reason. Jean-Luc takes one of the satchels.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance: \"We're rich!\" Vengeance has de-articulated the bones of the one Gerd brought up and is displaying the bones as if they are treasures. That skeleton also had a bracer so they each have one now.</div>\n<br />\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Walking towards Sandford.</strong></span></div>\n<br />\n<div>as they approach from the west, they can see the remnants of full walls, which are now just isolated guardposts. the road thy're on now leads down the center of the town towards the market square. there are a few neighborhoods, but the main roads run to the ports; there is a port up at the top called Melliansein. The main entrance is in the southeast. An area called Gentle's Beanch that's a sandy beach. the town is known for the sandflats. the hills that separate the sandflats from the river are known for their zinc deposits and sandstone that the town makes a lot of its buildings out of. the sand itself is used for glassmaking and the zinc from the hills can make an alloy Sandford Brass which is a particularly strong type of metal that some weapons are made out of. It's used for \"ceramic plates\" in bulletproof armor (does it make good armor or weapons?) -- it lends itself towards brittleness, but it can be made into excellent weapons. they can put an obsidian edge on the weapons which make them incredibly sharp. but do they break more freqnently than other weapons? seems to contradict saying they are strong.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance knows that sandford, now in early fall, holds a famous fishing competition around this time of year. they have very good fishing all year round. we're getting into virginia-style temperate weather. marlin, flounder, red-fish, bass, and tuna. competitions are held around now to see how can get the most and largest fish.</div>\n<br />\n<div>jean-luc has heard of a group called the Hat Baskets (\"weird naming convention\"); he can't quite recall the thieves can't for the name. they operate here in Sandford; they direct a lot of their attention eastward, because they are the first port west of the steeplepeak mountains, so if someone rounds the peak, they will land in Sandford first. the first place north that you can cross is at least 100 miles north at Saxifrage (\"rockbreaker\") Pass, where there is an outpost of Frost Orcs (local term) . they aren't evil orcs, but they aren't known to be comradely -- one might say they're chilly or frigid to strangers. you would have to go ever further north to find a proper welcoming trading town.</div>\n<br />\n<div>The town essentialy follows : hardscrabble properties on the outside, more elite / bourgeoise properties as you go further in, there's a lot of industry around the ports ; but it's a smallish town.</div>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Looking for some healing</span></strong></div>\n<div><br />\n<div>they are looking for temple or medicamentum at which to drop Fez.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeancae: fellows, please avoid the fishing competition or it will bring up some pretty bad memories for me. But I _would_ like to see the famous sandflats.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Do you think we're on a sightseeing trip?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: I'm just saying that if we happen to pass by, like they are kindof world famous, and it would be weird to go on with our lives and be like yeah we went to sandford but no we didn't see the sandflats.</div>\n<div>Flick: i'm not as interested as vengeance is, but it's a very different landscape from where I group up, and I have an inherent interest in ecological diversity.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: I'm just happy we're in a place with buildings. (He takes a deep breath of city air, looking around, and lets out a contended sigh) \"it sure beats hiding in a forest and going through underground caves with monsters trying to eat me\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL detects on the air the faint smell of salty brine, different from that of Fez (the wind blowing strongly up from the southeast), brackish waters. It leads him to believe ... the southern arm of the pony mountans come down and funnel the sea air past Sandford and Follicle Bay, where things get \"a little hairy\".</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick suggests heading to the plaza.</div>\n<br />\n<div>The only city Flick has experience with is Cressida. and the brief stay in marshbout, so she doesn't have a good comparative grasp of levels of civilization. this town strikes her fairly provincial understanding . Cressida is like \"athens in its heyday in terms of the qquality of its buildings\". it lounges along the shores of the lake for 11 miles. \"A lot of people say they're from cressida when they're actually from north breszleton.\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>__north breszleton__ / north breziltin</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick's parents (adoptive parents) have a nice house in the actual city -- but she was mostly raised on their farmholding to the northwest. Flick just grew up on the dacha and could never go to Moscow. she wasn't a point of pride ot that family, (though wasn't a shameful secret either). she was never part of that part of their lives. treated like the landscaper at times?</div>\n<br />\n<div>sandford is -- the buildings don't stand out in terms of height, ,at most 3-story buildings, except for religious buildings. a lot of lazy watertraffic, people fishing in the bay, some pleasure boating perhaps. for the most part it's incredibly approachable. the indutries are relegated to the outskirts. glass is a notoriously smelly business, and since the wind blows to the NW they try to keep those industries on the NW edge, and also nearer the sands. mostly sleepy houses with a shore-feeling town.</div>\n<br />\n<div>the market square is large for the town, and quite a few smaller ones are spread out as they approach the center. people ahve gardens around their plots, and a number of lackadaisical farms dotted the outlands. it's almost a party port stop, or vacation port stop, in part, for people rounding the peak. but it's not a \"resort town\" . there's a divide - the north are the cheaper houses, and to the right near gentle's beach might be more expensive houses with absentee landlord holdings.</div>\n<br />\n<div>The walls look like they're been maintained for academic or archaeological reasons. some of them have been rebuild in a cast? of the original walls. there are ancient inscriptions on them. where they end, at pillars, is a discrete ending; they are cut off succinctly. they aren't allowed to continue to crumble. sort of like sections of the great wall where tourists are allowed.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick: so it's part of a historical artefact. and it looks like the town might even take pride maintaining it. there is a tower far to the south, and up north, and the towers look like there is activity around them and being maintained. and they have nominal sections of wall connected to them.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick, as they're walking down the main road, looks for \"places of godly healing\". (should have made this investigation). See some churchlike structures, none in particular dedicated to gods of healing that she can see.</div>\n<br />\n<div><strong>Temple of Kashtari </strong>- few adornments on the outside, looks like a small ziggurat, carved out of sandstone. there's one large door that opens into darkness . no symbols of a god that they can see. (terraced compound of successively receding stories or levels) - there's a symbol of a double helix, horizontal, like an infinity sign with tails.</div>\n<div>(in historical ziggurats, the face bricks ('facings') were glazed or painted; astrological signs sometimes; kings names)</div>\n<div>- usually a staircase/ramp leading up, or around like a spiral</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance: looks like my kind of place.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc looks for thieve's cant symbols. The temple itself is completely devoid of any markings; they might get rubbed off or ground off (escept for the helix) . there's a post , a stone post with an iron rings, closer to the road. there's <strong>a symbol that means \"high risk high reward\" ,</strong> maybe (jean-luc only rolled a 9)</div>\n<br />\n<div>jean-luc glosses as \"enter at your own risk\". flick: what does that mean to you. JL: it means that these people probably aren't to be trifled with, but are probably holding some form of power and or riches, or else it would just be \"stay away\" . given that we're not looking to swindle them, surely there's no harm in talking to them.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick: ok, let's go in.</div>\n<div>They get up to the door and are still not greeted by anyone. as they go to enter through the darkness their path is impeded by an invisible wall or field of force.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick: \"Hello, if you have the services to offer that I think, we have someone in need of them\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>From the step above there is now visible a guard. they are wearing shiny, burnished, somewhat expensive-looking armor. there's a helmet, breastplate, and leg plates, and they are carrying a spear. [JL critical fail on investigation] tells him it's highest quality function and form. Sureit's made out of Sandford brass.</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL makes it a point to keep his hand as far away from his sword. Guard takes a look at you and points her spear at the group.</div>\n<div>\"Whose authority are you here on?\"</div>\n<div>JL considers pulling out the \"badge of tepplin\" but decides against it. \"We;re not here on anyone's authority. our friend needs help and we thought you might be able to help\"</div>\n<div>\"who is your friend and what do they need help with\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>Fez is walking in a half-daze behind dthem, being doted on by Cyrowan.</div>\n<br />\n<div>That one there, the bedraggled and smelly one?

I could really use some of it for my miming? mining? routine.</div>\n<br />\n<div>\"I'm not a geologist who's here to answer your questions, but it should be obvious to anyone that it's the famous Sandstone available only in Sandford.\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL: I think he's referring to the force-field ...</div>\n<div>Guard: Oh, the door? I'm not going to reveal the secrets of this sacred institution.</div>\n<div>Flick: I hope the bedside manner is a little more polished than the reception area.</div>\n<div>Guard: What's that?!</div>\n<div>Flick (repeats herself)</div>\n<div>Guard: I'm not paid to be a receptionist, I'm paid to keep rabble out of the front here.</div>\n<div>JL: and a fine job you're doing of it too.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Some rocks and sand cascade down around them as they walk cautiously towards the back.</div>\n<div>JL: as obnoxious as they are, i don't think we want to trifle with them.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Who gets to enter through the front?</div>\n<div>Guard: Only those authorized to do so . if you know how to get in, then that means you're authorized. I guess, you know what, I am here as a bit of a receptionist. There's not much people can do if they can't get in. But look the only thing polished about my manner is my armor, and that's the way I'd like to keep it.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: so you're basically just here to tell people to go around back.</div>\n<div>Guard: I'm not out here all the time. i only came out here because I saw confused visitors come up to the front, and it was clear you didn't know how to get through the door.</div>\n<div>vengeance: so what is your usual job?</div>\n<div>guard: that's another one of the ineffable secrets of the temple!</div>\n<div>vengeanec: well perhaps we shall learn it soon</div>\n<div>guard: only if you are qualified as determined by the most esoteric of the practitioners</div>\n<div>2nd guard: \"woooooooooooooooooo\"</div>\n<div>vengeance: now i'm spooked; ok guys let's do what they said</div>\n<div>(guards hi-five in the distance)</div>\n<br />\n<div>the temple is pretty large, the size of a block, which means like 150 ft square. it goes up almost as high. they come around the back, towards the back the temple extends as 12-foot high walls, and there's a tiny opening in the walls into a back courtyard. as they look into the courtyard, there are dozens of cots and bedrolls laid out, and on almost all of them are humanoids in various stages of decomposition, but still alive. the stench is a wall of marsh and decaying flesh.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance: it looks like he'd be ok here. why don't we just dump him and be on our way.</div>\n<div>JL: i'm not against that on principle, but we should probably talk to someone first.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Making their way amongst the cots and bedding are people carrying fresh bedding, cloths, pitchers of water, bandages, and medicine, and applying them as need be. they are setting up tents and coverings. there's even the beginning of the construction of a pavilion top to the rear portico.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick: these are humans that are kind of making do with what they have, rather than druids/elves who would know better, or clerics that can invoke religion power.</div>\n<div>vengeance and JL: the outfits the caretakers are wearing covers their bottom halves entirely and looks almost more like a bustle or billow floor-length skirt. all the people delivering the care are of a type. it looks like they've been swimming in chlorinated pools. there is some treatment that the bourgoisie use for their personal swimming coves, athat makes your hair look a little green, and these people all have that creenish tinge to their hair; they are immaculately tanned, and none of them are wearing tops, they just have chiselled muscles, perfectly adonis-like bodies, both men and women.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengenace goes to lift a bustle. [sleight of hand ]. his hand passes right through the cloth , and they keep on walking like nothing has happened. on scrutiny, the people evince a smoother, almost wavelike motion, bobbing from back to front or up and down.</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL wonders if these are servants, or mind control, or constructs of a magician. how much feels malevolent? [criticall fails -- JL is sure that it's either mind control or servant constructs. doesn't know why there would be a fabric component.]</div>\n<br />\n<div>as he's thinking this, another one comes past and lick their lips a bit, or flick their tongue out. \"Oh, do you have another one?\"</div>\n<div>flick: another what?</div>\n<div>nurse 1: the ... seigmerrin. the marsh-sick.</div>\n<div>flick: he does smell like a marsh.</div>\n<div>nurse 1: bring him over here. (she motions to a cot)</div>\n<div>flick: we're gonna be close by, fez</div>\n<div>vengeance (whispers) i think it was a good sign she licked her lips like that. we can probably entrust fez to their healing and leave him here.</div>\n<div>JL :these people are clearly being controlled by something ; the question is whether or not it's of their own volition. [perception as he's looking around paranoiacally - sees on the 3rd level, above the one the guards were on, actually windows of a sort; they are round, and JL sees a face which appears briefly, looks down, and quickly hides behind the wall.]</div>\n<div>JL communicates this to his companions. they agree not to leave Fez's side for the moment.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Nurse1 leads fez to the cot and lay him back. another nurse:</div>\n<div>hello my name is odeshka. may I examine your friend here.</div>\n<div>flick: ye splease</div>\n<div>odeshka: do you know his symptoms? what has he been experiencing. i can detect the smell, but the other signs are absent. there doesn't appear to be decomp or salt crystals forming on open wounds.</div>\n<div>flick: he's been this way only a day or so. he used to have a holy presence to him; he projected an aura of safety or security. ever since we --- it's gradually been replaced with this nauseating fish odor. it could be that he was supernatural to begin with, but he's not getting better</div>\n<div>vengeance: he also doesn't have insurance</div>\n<br />\n<div>as Odeshka stepped closer, she didn't appear to be affected by fez's smell.</div>\n<div>Flick is the only one (with a 10+) with her heightened elven smelling that the smell of the courtyard was qualitatively different from fez's smell, which was nauseating in a kind of otherworldly way.</div>\n<div>even given that, Odeshka puts a cloth up to her nose that's soaked in some kind of odorifugous liquid.</div>\n<br />\n<div>What did you say? Only a day he's been like this. Usually the symptoms come on much slower. Some of the patients have been infected for weeks. Either this is a strain we don't know of or your friend is suffering from something different. I certainly wouldn't mind taking a closer look if you have any more details.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick: i notice that this started when he (eyes Cyrowan) joined up with us.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: ever since I knew master fez, his cleanliness has been a bit of an issue. he does try to pawn it off on others. but it's one of my primary duties.</div>\n<div>Flick: this is one of the areas where Cyrowan is prevaricating or lying about what might be going on. -- Cyrowan is part of split; he's lying but believes his own lies.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: I wouldn't blame myself or master fez; some of us have to deal with this from birth.</div>\n<div>Flick: I don't think anything bad happened in that underground temple.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: He's been like this since I knew him. The first person I knew was Vengeance. I haven't found _him_ to be smelly, as much as his presence offends the rest of you.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Odeshka: yeah, this doesn't seem to be the marsh sickness, about which you don't know anything.</div>\n<div>JL: we know a little about a lot of things, but this isn't one of them.</div>\n<div>Odeshka: we get a lot of people in the town who crossed through the steaplepeak marshes; a lot of them are birdwatchers or entomologists or biologists; before they can make it to the marshbout marsh they are overtaken by this sickness which seems ultimately to convert their bodies into peat, soil, and salt crystals.</div>\n<div>Flick: yeah we hope that's not happening to our friend. his only symptom is the smell -- which is different.</div>\n<div>Odeshka: yes, my care may not be the most efficatious here. let me get one of our spiritual leaders.</div>\n<br />\n<div>She walks over to the temple and speaks to a very small person -- a child, wearing the same garb. maybe a spiritual child prodigy or something? they come over, carrying a staff, which is a serpent curled around a quarterstaff. in the serpent's mouth is a black, multifaceted gem, with hundreds or thousands of facets. it could be jasper or obsidian or something.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick (yes, i associate that symbol with healers in the cressida region. that strikes me as medical.)</div>\n<br />\n<div>the child comes over. My name is Vacca, and I am the head priest here. Odeshka told me you have someone who does not have the marsh sickness, but needs spiritual help.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: See, that's what you should sound like by now, Cyrowan?</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: Isn't that what I do sound like? Fez has never given me vocal lessons.</div>\n<div>Vacca: no matter with this piercingly voiced creature</div>\n<div>Vengeance: maybe you and Cyrowan can have a discussion between you two.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vacca: can you bring the halfling down here? Flick thinks about lowering the cot but picks Fez up and brings him down. Vacca: thanks, my height isn't what it used to be.</div>\n<div>Fez's health has deteriorated significantly. his head lols back and his eyes are unfocused.</div>\n<div>Vacca puts the gem of the staff against Fez's forehead, and concentric black rings start to radiate outward from the point of contact and outwards towards fez's extremities.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick looks at Cyrowan, and the same concentric rings are appearing across his body. Cyrowan doesn't really notice at first, and then you can see that little black buds start to emerge from his body that look someone like the tentacles he used against Gorph. Vacca pulls the staff away when he sees this on Cyrowan.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vacca: it appears that your friend is under the influence of a great evil, which controls, or at least retains, some kind of eye on him through a proxy, but I'm not sure what that could be (nodding surreptitiously towards Cyrowan.) It's difficult to fathom that you would be unaware of the identity of the proxy, so I can only assume that they haven't made contact with you.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick advances on Cyrowan, grabs him by the shoulder, and muscles him into the street.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Cyrowan: Mistress Flick, you're going to leave Fez alone with that child priest?</div>\n<br />\n<div>At the street, Flick throws him in front of her trying to cast him onto the ground. as his ass hits the ground, she brings her bow around and drwaw on him. \"You have 5 seconds to deliver a satisfactory explanation for your presence and fez's deterioration or god help me i will make a motherfucking pincushion out of you.\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL gets behind Cyrowan to tabletop him.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance to Vaka: what's the deal with your height? you said you used to be taller?</div>\n<div>Vaka: Yes, all Manush shrink in height as we age. and he lets the illusion drop, and the bottom half of his body is serpentine.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: this makes a lot more sense</div>\n<div>Vaka: yes, you know , all snakes get smaller as they age. it removes the largest layer and you get smaller.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: so you just have a ton of layers of skin that you shed throughout your life?</div>\n<div>Vaka: it's sort of like our existing body gets more compressed, and stronger and efficient as we age, so we need less bulk. it's sort of like the cutting phase. it doesn't matter; we have biology tests inside the temple.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: so how big do you start?</div>\n<div>Vaka: did you see the guards?</div>\n<div>Vengeane: how old was she?</div>\n<div>Vaka: maybe six months?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: she's pretty ornery for six months</div>\n<div>Vaka: well she's going through a teething phase. we set them up as receptionists trying to establish kind of a sense of duty and work habits in the young; for outsiders it's quite intimidating.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: it must hurt if your bones are getting more and more dense</div>\n<div>Vaka: yes, it does, you kind of have inverse growth plates. but at the same time you're secure in the knowledge that you're stronger than you've ever been.</div>\n<br />\n<div>[OUT IN THE STREET]</div>\n<div>Flick draws her bow, grabbing the arrow and whispering \"find his heart\" (hunter's mark)</div>\n<br />\n<div>Cyrowan: i appreciate all your concern for master fez, but you should know by now it takes more than 5 secondns for me to get out a greeting. other than being fez's squire -- thta's my motivating impulse in life. it is true that i don't remember much of my life before I met vengeance. and ... it is strange that I can grow tentacles and levitate people. (flick sees a stream of wetness, closer to the mammary line, emerge (is it pee?) )</div>\n<br />\n<div>when she had said \"find his heart\", the arrow pointed towards his mid-thigh.</div>\n<br />\n<div>cyrowan: sometimes I do hear advice coming to me; i thought it was from one of the recesses of my brain, but it does appear to emerge from a deep sea creature. something with tentacles and an immortal hatred for the surface world.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeanec: \"that's puberty!\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>Cyrowan: yep, that's puberty. -- I hope that's enough of an explanation.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick: well, to the innocent shell, my apologies, and shoots at Cyrowan's thigh</div>\n<br />\n<div>(rolling initiative)</div>\n<br />\n<div>the vibration of the arrow erases it from fletching to the point, and out of it grows a scintillating needle of force that is going to fly and strike cyrowan in the thigh (aka planar warrior)</div>\n<br />\n<div>his body is wracked by the force pumelling. mistress flick, what else can I tell you? he scrambles backwards, unknowingly towards JL.</div>\n<div>flick: not good enough! and knocks another arrow and shoots. cyrowan's guts and heart chamber? fall out of his thigh, and then he collapses onto the ground in a puddle of organs.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick to self: this wasn't my fault. something was wrong with the guy.</div>\n<div>flick finds JL's eyes. \"I really thought that would go differently\"</div>\n<div>JL: i'm not sure why you thought it would, but I'm not broken up about it.</div>\n<br />\n<div>as flick looks for another life force to target, cyrowan's body starts to levitate, but it's sort of like the magician's trick where you're holding yourself up by a foot. his intestines, which have become tentacles underneath him, like an upside-down anemone.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick: THIS is how i thought it would go.</div>\n<br />\n<div>cyrowan's head cracks backwards, so that it's full flat against his back and looking up at the heavens. \"cyrowan\" per se is gone. they hear a voice, which fez could attest to having heard. \"seduce the righteous\" they both get DIS on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</div>\n<br />\n<div>you fools! don't you know that fez has given up his claim on Ulimara, and she has cast him back on the sea for whoever would take him. i thought he would be wise enough to take me up on the bargain; and now you wish to take from him his only access to these deific powers? if he doesn't want me, and none of you want these powers, than your lives are forfeit when next we meet.</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL: scarier things than you have made these threats</div>\n<div>abzu: i doubt you would say that if we met face to face. and as you can see i can appear in the most unlikely guises, such as this never suspected curious juvenile of a man. you always thought he was upright and following fez's orders.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance: i knew all along</div>\n<div>abzu: you did not!</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick can feel that there's something to what it's saying, as much as she doesn't believe it. [wisdom saving throw] flick really has to hype herself up internally to get her hunter's mark to land. suddenly she doesn't know where in her mind she could mark a creature, but it eventually lands.</div>\n<div>abzu: did you feel that, elf? feeling like that can be your eternal torment</div>\n<div>flick: you know my name</div>\n<div>abzu: i do, but it's more ominous to say \"elf\" . and your full name is pretentious, and i'm not going to use a nickname.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance: just think of him as a giant donut, JL! not a jelly donut, obviously</div>\n<div>JL does hit, sinking his rapier into the cadaver; the whole thing deflates at his touch, and it whispers: you'll be seeing me. and the cadaver goes limp on the ground.</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL: great, we've made another creepy enemy.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vaka turns to look up at Vengeance and winks: I think whatever I've done here has taken effect quite quickly on your friend. as JL and flick return, fez has fallen into a restful sleep and no longer emanates that smell</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance: vaka, you truly are a miracle worker. but i have to wonder if, given what you said, Fez _is_ the parasite.</div>\n<div>vaka: from the perspective of the deities, that could very well be the case. it may be why he's been cast off in this way. i can no longer sense his connection to his paladin patron.</div>\n<div>flick: he'll have to take care of that himself.</div>\n<div>vaka: from what i know of the oaths of the halflins, he must recommit himself before he can see another's powers shine through him.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance: what happened to that boy that was with us?</div>\n<div>flick: the boy?</div>\n<div>vengeance: no, no.</div>\n<div>vaka: the halfling is quite small -- is that?</div>\n<div>flick: you mean cyrowan?</div>\n<div>vengeance: yeah yeah that's his name. i hope he's ok.</div>\n<div>flick: his troubles are over</div>\n<div>vengeance: cool.</div>\n<div>vaka: with my excellent human hearing i could tell he was dispatched outside the walls. thank you for not blaspheming the temple with that act.</div>\n<div>flick: i wouldn't do you like that.</div>\n<div>vaka: one never knows what outsiders will bring into a sacred temple</div>\n<div>JL: yeah --- we've been guilty of that a time or two</div>\n<div>flick: that's true, we've definitely profaned a thing or two.</div>\n<div>vaka: see, i wasn't wrong to worry. in any case, i don't know if your errands bring you here for other reasons, but you're more than welcome to put him up at the temple. we can't offer accommodations. most of the space inside is for residence, and even our medical beds have been extended beyond capacity. i have at least 1 or 2 relatives who would open their doors to you, or I can recommend a place. probably for a small donation ?</div>\n<div>vengeance: so ... could i have that staff?</div>\n<div>vaka: i'm sorry the staff is of personal and sociocultural meaning to us here so i have to refuse you the staff</div>\n<div>JL hits vengeance to shut up.</div>\n<div>JL gives Vaka 4 ? gold pieces</div>\n<div>vaka: ah, Jean-Luc, such a mighty beneficence. any resources we have are at your disposal. i'm sorry i can't offer a tour of the temple as its closed for renovations.</div>\n<div>JL: i only ask that you take good care of our bed and point us toward a comfortable bed and warm fire for the evening.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick: i don't feel comfortable in any establishment, but you've been roughing it with us so why don't you call the shots.</div>\n<div>JL: i could go for a taste of the good life again. if not the plaza, then the upper echelons.</div>\n<br />\n<div>as they pass by the plaza, some fall festivities are going on, and the fisherpeople are displaying their fish; huge fish are on display, and for sale -- softshell clams and crustaceans from steaplepeak marsh. all sorts of goods and wares for sale. trinkets and gems have been mined and brought from the zinc hills.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick &amp; jl: ready for bed</div>\n<div>vengeance: i'm still ready to party. should we get some squid on a stick and buy some weapons</div>\n<div>JL: i have been meaning to find a good dagger</div>\n<br />\n<div>inn: Monarch's Pelt</div>\n<div>Hat Basket contact: Reminda</div>\n<br />\n<div>Yolindar is teh Gaol Maiden leader who wants JL on a pike</div>\n<div>vengeance got some shrimp from an old man who tried to give him a hand job</div>\n<div>flick reads a lot of true crime</div>\n<br /><br /></div>"}

In the early morning, Flick found herself for the first time by another elf unrequiring of nought but a daily trance. Hieronymus's&nbsp;importunate jonesing for a novel deletery<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;arrested a friendship&nbsp;in potentia&nbsp;but catalyzed a chary trance which began a battue<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/recap/25#fn2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;out of a nearby goblin named Bampot. After being patronized by Flick and unsatisfactorily reassured as to the group's grithfulness[^grithfulness], Bampot was first mistaken for one Feekus by Hieronymus. They soon discovered their shared identification as goinfre[^goinfre] with respect to animal and vegetal poison, and Bampot introduced Hieronymus to the practice of bakhaqalaj[^bakhaqalaj].

Unfortunately for their would-be masters, norkers are rebellious, truculent, and&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: #337ab7; text-decoration-line: none;\" href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb\">prone</a>&nbsp;to indolence unless watched with a keen eye and a hand that is quick to snap a whip.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\" data-title-index=\"34\">Denizens of the Deep Earth.</span>&nbsp;\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0.7em; display: inline;\">In the ancient days, norkers were found deep within the earth. They were always few in number, and their god was a cruel, merciless tyrant who kept his children close and the outside world at a distance. This long-lost god may have been Maglubiyet's first conquest and his followers the initial, unwilling recruits into his crusade. Today, hobgoblins chafe at the suggestion that creatures as lazy and untamed as norkers could claim such an honor. For that reason alone, hobgoblin warlords are loath to use these creatures, preferring to keep them around as disposable labor in mines and quarries.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px;\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 5px;\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\" data-title-index=\"35\">Nasty, Brutish, and Short.</span>&nbsp;\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0.7em; display: inline;\">Even goblins bully and harass norkers, as hobgoblins place the norkers at the bottom of the goblinoid ranks, yet the norkers' ferocity, tough hides, and sharp fangs allow them to rise up and defeat goblinoids that underestimate the norkers' strength and ferocity.. For this reason, norkers are likely encountered away from their brethren. Their natural armor and weapons make them dangerous foes even when relegated to menial labor. Only the dictates of Maglubiyet have prevented the hobgoblins from hunting down and exterminating these creatures.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px;\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\" data-title-index=\"36\">A Legacy of Hatred.</span>&nbsp;\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-indent: 0.7em; display: inline;\">Given their ancient defeat and terrible treatment at the hands of other goblinoids, the norkers have developed a peculiar sect of Maglubiyet worshipper. They call him the Great Scourge and believe that mortal life is a cruel test. Those norkers whose skin can withstand any blow and whose fangs sink deep into their enemies will be shepherded to paradise. To the norkers, all other creatures are enemies. Strong creatures can be mollified with servitude and obsequious begging, while weaker ones are victims for their fangs and clubs.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

(urban-style stimulants). Paros has <em>Haste</em>? Jean-Luc has a soggy vial of fizzlecoke; Cyrowan probably dripped into it at one point.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: It got a little wet, but if you want I've had worse stimulants than this fizzlecoke here.</p>\n<p>Startrella: You got some wet fizzlecoke? I know just the trick. I know how to dry that stuff out.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Oof. .. Yeah, what's the trick.</p>\n<p>Startrella: I guess you just heat it up for a while. You have to make sure you don't burn the coke. You use a dry double-boiler situation.</p>\n<p>Flick: So the trick is evaporation.</p>\n<p>Startrella: Yeah! That's it! Travelling amongst the stars you learn so much physics it can be really helpful. And it expands your minds for those times your mind is primed to expand. (She wanders over).</p>\n<p>Flick: Hey, Startrella, our friend Udrek doesn't want anything to bring him down this early in the morning. Would you happen to have any powders or stimulants or \"caffeinated\" substances we can give him?</p>\n<p>Startrella: Like i was saying, if one of you does something real nice for me, I can take one of these starmotes and pretty much turn it into anything.</p>\n<p>Flick: Real nice? Like what?</p>\n<p>Startrella: I dunno -- nothing's coming to me off the top of the dome.</p>\n<p>Flick: Like, if we helped you across the strees, or carried your grocery bags while you were trying to open a door? That kind of thing, or were you speaking in code?</p>\n<p>Startrella: Yeah like if you dig a hole and fill it with water and place your cloak over it that might do the trick.</p>\n<p>Flick: [Insight 13: if flick can create a meditative environment or pull her into the ethereal place; something to provide a sensory deprivation environment]. (Flick walks over; )</p>\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Vengeance: It's not me, it's my sentient staff that likes to pet &hellip; not ogres, but &hellip; your wonderful pet. I apologize for my staff's behavior. (His feet begin scraping a hole in the ground.)</p>\n<p>Glug: Udrek isn't my pet. We grew up in the same town! This is all looking a bit fishy. (He comes over and interposes himself between Udrek and the others.) I'm not unsure what you're trying to do here. Udrek can make his own decisions. All this fudging around with his head while we're eating -- I think you should just make your way on.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc pretends to trip in order to attempt to knock the circlet off. [two nat 20s to touch and deceive] He does it so delicately that, as he tries to pull it off, he can feel that it's embedded in Gluggranok's head, under the skin and adherent to the skull. [Strength] The circlet comes loose from his skull under one adhesion point and Jean-Luc gets as finger under it and pulls up (and out). Glugg screams as a clump of scalp tears off and he goes completely catatonic.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: I'm sorry, I tripped on this tree over here. -- No, I'm not sorry, this is how I do things.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: Master Luc, this isn't how you get the ladies. Not by being a drunk and a stumbler.</p>\n<p>Flick: Shut up, squire, nobody asked you.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: I'm Fez's squire, how dare you talk to me that way. Lord Fez, tell him!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Initiative rolled</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Udrek reaches behind his back, produces a massive chipped claymore, and swings at Jean-Luc with his non-coke-fingernailed hand. Jean-Luc is hurt. Paros, pulling out some sweet aromatic oils and a fizzlecyst tongue, casts Suggestion and imposes disadvantage, \"I [Udrek] don't remember putting that fire out yesterday&hellip; \" Udrek fails. \"Oh. Trees. At. Risk. Of Fire?\" Jean-Luc feels the kettlehelmet trembling, and Flick has a distant memory of being compelled to put out the bar fires. \"The fire is no joke!\" Yells Flick.</p>\n<p>Nerch climbs up onto the cart and attempts to push the boxes off the cart. \"Hee. Hooo. Heeww.\" The cart rises up into the air as if on hydraulic suspension. Three boxes fall off the back of the cart, and one cracks open. It looks like the cat bus from My Neighbor Totoro, but without a cat face. Or eyes. But it can somehow see where you are. The Cart (Carty B) reverses and attempts to slam into Flick, who jumps nimbly out of the way.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc and Drav intuit that Nerch was an urchin, and was called Nurchin as a kid to make fun of her. It's probably why she gets along with Udrek, who's being raised as an Organiborg Hobgolem.</p>\n<p>The rear door of the cart's bed flips up to provide cover for Nerch.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: I'm here to support you, Ms Drav, as Fez is indisposed with raging fish diarrhea.</p>\n<p>Joan: I can't concentrate with all this gosh dang noise! (and rushes 80 ft closer to the fray and goes into a rage for various reasons -- \"I need to know about this protocol!\")</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc gives Udrek a wide berth, comes up to Gluggranok, and rips the metal circlet off his head with a sickening tearing sound. The circlet comes off the head with chunks of hair and skin attached, almost his entire scalp, and even laminae of his skull. Udrek bellows in a rage, altho the possible fire looms larger in his mind. \"Forest. Important. Friend. In Pain. Conundrum. Using algorithm. To Decide.\" Jean-Luc dashes for the treeline. Gluggranok remains passed out on the ground.</p>\n<p>Flick runs up a nearby tree; \"A mere wagon skin is no barrier to the power of the planes\" as she marks Nerch and sharpshoots at her, wounding her significantly with the shots. Startrella: What are those cool ripples you're making over there?</p>\n<p>Nerch: I tried to get them to spring for a top to this thing. Maybe I should have tried a bit harder.</p>\n<p>Flick: That five gold you saved isn't looking so great now, is it?</p>\n<p>Nerch: No, just Udrek's learning board would have covered this. He has an invisible one, but the other one's made of wood, and that would have been great. -- and she loses concentration, at which point the cart reverts to inanimation. -- Carty, no! Carty B!! I lost Carty A a while ago. Carty A's the one with the top on it. You should see Carty C, it doesn't even have wheels, it's just on runners.</p>\n<p>Flick envisions the headlines after a fireball: Carty B model recalled due to flammability.</p>\n<p>Drav expertly places a fireball over Nerch's head; Flick sees that the entire wagon catches on fire, and Nerch is engulfed in flame and dies.</p>\n<p>Flick: Poor Nerch, we hardly knew ye.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: I'm not entirely sure we're not the bad guys here. But &hellip; I'm o.k. with it.</p>\n<p>Flick immediately hears the sound of arrows thudding into the trees around her. Targetted by an expert archer herself this time, she is pierced by arrows.</p>\n<p>Rovlar: For Nerch! Nerch won't die unrevenged!</p>\n<p>Flick: It's AVENGED!</p>\n<p>Rovlar: \"Revenged\" -- it's &hellip; hobgoblin slang!?</p>\n<p>Carlos jumps onto Mule, who carries the dashing, sturdy cleric closer to the battle. Startrella, still in the trance, remains &hellip; in the trance.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Hey, Jean-Luc, do you mind if I give that device that you're holding a whirl. I just want to see what happens if I plug in. -- Jean-Luc tosses Vengeance the circlet, and the monk takes the prongs and jams them into his \"brain\" .. or however it was placed in Gluggranok's head.</p>\n<p>Flick: Oh, god damnit!</p>\n<p>Vek: I'm not sure they know what they're doing here, but that could be very powerful domination magic in those things. -- Drav tends to agree with Vek here.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: You guys really like playing around with cerebral restylings, don't you. I mean, Lord Paros has enough going on to cover for everyone. If I were under the effects of an ancient higher power, I bet you all would know about it right away, you're so clever and attuned to things.</p>\n<p>[Galen's computer freezes, so I throw to Carlos for healing.]</p>\n<p>For a minute Vengeance feels his brain get cloudy and finds thinking difficult. He briefly feels bound to protect the contents of the boxes and take them somewhere. He feels comradely feelings towards Udrek and Gluggranok and Rovlar, and a generalized compliance with a nebulous force of masters. But then it looks like it didn't adhere to his body properly; some of the metal wiring snapped, and it doesn't seem like it would work anymore. (Maybe if he'd used a fizzlecyst fixative&hellip;) \"Everyone, I think I know what's going on here: mind control. I believe I've solved the case.\"</p>\n<p>Carlos casts Healing Word on Jean-Luc.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Take it from me, and --</p>\n<p>Rovlar (aka Vengeance): I adopt vengeance as my name! -- What were you saying?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: If I could just say to you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's a difficult life, and I don't recommend it. If I were you I would pack it in now. -- And he casts Confusion (Qi-xotic confusion) on Rovlar. Fez continues eating some wet grass.</p>\n<p>Vek: Fez doesn't really look like he knows what he's doing anymore. You should take care of him.</p>\n<p>Cyrowan: Yes - what should I do?</p>\n<p>Vek: Should go back and check on him I think.</p>\n<p>Udrek: Poor. Nerch. Will extinguish. This fire. Later. Other fire. Now.</p>\n<p>Paros fires a fire bolt at the branch on which Rovlar is standing, but it falls short, adding more flames to Nerch's pyre.</p>\n<p>Udrek: Nother. Fire. Nooooooo.</p>\n<p>Joan sits down next to a tree in order to be able to punch it and maintain her rage. Jean-Luc dashes into another bunch of trees.</p>\n<p>Rovlar: Vengeance will visit you too! I see you making your way across the open ground.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: You know you could surrender.</p>\n<p>Rovlar: Why surrender when I have the tactical advantage of being higher off the ground than you?</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: You're outnumbered.</p>\n<p>Vengeance: Jean-Luc, take a break here, I'm going to handle things.</p>\n<p>Gluggranok remains unconscious and continues to lose blood.</p>\n<p>Flick sharpshoots Rovlar, hitting once, and -- You'll never get another arrow that high! (Rovlar) -- missing -- I told you! -- at which Flick disappears into the Etherial plane, the Magician Archer and sky-walks out his movement speed to between two trees. [Perception 17]. Though never having done this before, Flick acclimates rapidly, and sees the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the distance where Aphelia and Cyrowan are, Flick sees the merging of a dark black and bright white smoke</li>\n<li>Where Drav is, Flick sees very faintly and rippling, the figure of Eldar suspended inside a massive suit of crystalline-light plate armor</li>\n<li>Startrella, sitting there, in her papasan, is trying a couple different ways of trying out the fizzlecoke in the ethereal plane</li>\n<li>Paros looks like a buffet; heaping, steaming trays of spirit food</li>\n<li>Behind Flick, reddish-gold tendrils, like smokey vines, hundreds of them emerging from the boxes on the ground, and going straight up into the sky, disappearing a hundred feet up due in part to the limited visibility of the ethereal plane. A single tendril emerges each from Udrek and Rovlar.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- --><!-- -->\n<div>Drav dashes closer to Gluggranok intending to stabilizer her next turn. Mule, bored, makes her way down to a freestanding cabin a few hundred feet south.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Where did that elf go? It's probably because I'm so high up and she's so far down, she gave up her tactical advantage. I'm trained in the arts of battle and strategy!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Listen, 'Vengeance', I feel a great deal of sympathy for you, and I understand where you're coming from.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: A true warrior doesn't need sympathy.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Of course not. I only offer you understanding. And solidarity. When I was a child, I had a very controlling father. Perhaps you know what it's like being under control yourself by a tyrannical device or whatever it is that's controlling you. I want you to know that it's okay. When I failed my fishermans exams, my father beat me near to death, and that changed the course of my life, and I realized I didn't have to be under his control anymore. So why don't you just come down from there and we'll unhook you from that thing, and you can live your life as a free hobgoblin.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I too used to be subject to the whip. I would go out in the evenings looking for midges, those delicious little bugs, and a few times I was caught by monsters, and my parents would beat me, but I always took it as a sign that they loved me!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Oh, you love midges too?</div>\n<div>Rovlar: One of my favorite delicacies.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: What's your favorite kind?</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I like the slarm &hellip; ones. Buttermidges. Blue-green midge, i like it for the taste, even tho people think it's a panacea.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: You know if you pour some fizzlecoke onto a midge and pop it in your mouth it'll explode. And my goodness, the sensation is wonderful.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Like a pop midge? Vengeance: Midge pop.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: nouns!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Well you are a very knowledgeable lady. I wish you would come down from there. I don't want to have to hurt you. You're probably an innocent person. I want to get that thing off of you, so come down.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: You want to get what off of me?</div>\n<div>Vengeanec: The mind-control device.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: You mean the way that the desire for midges controls my mind?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: It is a very powerful desire. but I'm talking about this (holds up circlet)</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Why are you holding that?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: I just found it. &hellip; This is what you're wearing right now.

But the cap -- absolutely not!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: I promise, once you come down, we'll go on a full midge hunt, fry them up, it'll be delicious.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Why can't we do that with the cap on. In fact, you all look like you would wear these caps well. In fact, I can extoll their virtues to you at length.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Just come down and we can talk about that.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Is that blood on that cap you're holding.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: No, I just had it in my bag with some loose newt jelly.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Oh, a platter of Bertram's midges with newt jelly (and he begins drooling out of his nose as hobgoblins do).</div>\n<div>Vengeance: quick, somebody cast a freezing smell and then we can pull him down by his saliva.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Oh, i thought you were going to eat my drool as icicle treats. I've heard those are pretty tasty.</div>\n<div>[Deception check for newt jelly. ] In the Ethereal Plane, Flick sees people as kind of ghostly shapes without sharp details.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Ok, so it's not blood, but I don't want to let you near my cap: this is important to me.</div>\n<div>Flick and Vengeance have an ominous feeling, perhaps that they are being watched. Flick can see blue, gem-like or gravelly twinklings on the ground below her. like stones spread out through the grass. She decides to attack Rovlar from within the Ethereal Plane into the Material Plane using force damage.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'll avenge Glug too! Even though he's pitiable and still alive.</div>\n<div>Carlos heals Gluggranok, The wound in his heel closes up with just a bit of residual bruising and looks like he's sleeping.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: What's going on over there, did you help him? I thought i was going to have to avenge him.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: We don't have a quarrel with you.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Then why did you kill Nerch!?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Well, we <em>had</em> a quarrel with Nerch.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'm not sure why you think a quarrel with her is different from one with me. Although, I suppose, if it was about midges -- she does really despise midges, and I could see how that could escalate into immolation.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Yeah, that was the reason, you're right.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: We're happy to end this without further bloodshed.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: So you'll just make your way south. Can you dispell whatever you did to Udrek?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: It'll wear off. He's basically going to sprint for a minute.</div>\n<div>Drav: I think it's for 8 hours--&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Either way it'll wear off.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: WIthout Carty-B or Udrek I'm kindof defenceless here. I mean, tactically, I have an advantage, but defensively, I'm at a disadvantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Like I said we're not looking to hurt you.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Ok, then &hellip; go away.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc. Can't do that. [Persuasion ?]&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'll come halfway down the tree &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Good first step.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: In exchange, will you get Udrek to come back? Or, you know what? I'd really like to see Gluggranok conscious.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc glances over at Carlos.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: What is in those boxes, anyway?</div>\n<div>Rovlar: that's a great question, Vengeance. They are supplies that we need to get to the coast. It's probably best if you leave them alone. I think that handling them will give you a tactical disadvantage. It's wise to proceed south. You know what, don't even worry about Udrek or Glugg. Why don't you head south, I'll take care of this.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: If there's anything I hate it's a tactical disadvantage. I think I'll just take a quick peak to see what's inside.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: I'd really suggest you not do that.</div>\n<div>Carlos slaps Glugg awake, but his eyes don't focus and it looks like he's awake but he's dissociated from what's going on around him.</div>\n<div>Paros (has he read something on the trauma involved in separating from a hive-mind?) walks over to examine Gluggranok.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: (in the distance) the way you're taking care of yourself, master, is really going to pot. I love grass as much as the next person but you should really give it a rest.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc is remaining aware. Gluggranok's eyes refocus, and he sees that Vengeance is holding the metal cap, and he goes to grab it out of his hands.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Woh, Gluggs, this is mine now. -- and he skips out of the way. Glugg starts moaning inarticulately. -- Oh, man, this guy is going through some serious withdrawal. Startrella, do you know of anything we can do to help him? any clinics we can send him to?</div>\n<div>Startrella: This looks like &hellip; maybe he's been on too many drugs at once. Usually I say put in him a drunk tank. Wait, what's he doing now?</div>\n<div>Gluggranok has started making his way back towards the boxes. He arrives at the closest box and feverishly starts pulling out all the packing material.</div>\n<div>Flick latches onto Rovlar's shimmery ghostly form and fires onto her. [As an Unseen Attacker, Flick gets advantage on the attack.] By Rovlar's lights, he's blasted back like a fat man getting hit in the stomach by an invisible cannon ball. Flick hears his groans of pain through the Charlie Brown Adult wah-wah filter. Flick comes out of the EP and hits her with another arrow; Rovlar's dark purple blood begin to stain the tree.</div>\n<div>Rovlar: My sweet midge blood!</div>\n<div>Flick: Is this not what we're doing?</div>\n<div>Vengeance: It is unfortunate that you did that. On the other hand. .. (and he eyes getting over and drinking some blood)</div>\n<div>Rovlar: Vengeance, my midge-infused blood makes a delicious (syrup) / rock-candy!</div>\n<div>[end of session]</div>"}

You come up to, what, my waist?</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Thank you, small one, for the compliment, but I assure you that I'm much taller than I seem.</p>\n<p>Flick: I'm going to level with you, Pjorg, being around our group but not a part of our group tends to go badly for people. Are you lost?</p>\n<p>Pjorg: I'm currently trying to decide if that was a threat or not. Flick: Just a statistically valid generalization. Jean-Luc: It's an empirical fact. Turns out the p-value of people who die vs. people who live Haigy: Well within a single standard deviation! Jean-Luc procedes to tell him about Cyrowan, who meant well, but who ... died. He had to ... go. That's just what happens when you're on the periphery. Flick: If by \"meant well\" you mean served as the anchor for some kind of hideous eldritch kraken.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg insight check. 13. Jean-Luc isn't telling the whole truth, and may have been more culpable than he is admitting. Pjorg is looking for someone to watch his back and wander with as he searches for things. \"Small one, I will allow you and your friends to join me.\" Flick, used to endorsing eccentricities, rolls her eyes. \"It would be a real priviledge. We're in a mission to rescue a creature from those who would exploit it ,and you're welcome along.\"&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: let's pick up our bedrools and head towards the opening. I think these stones are messing with us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gerd's gender depends on its favored terrain. (Earth, sea, sky).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc CON check. Slake is pot + laudanum. 1d4. He has 2 levels of exhaustion for 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL, too tired to argue one way or the other, lets Flick carry his stuff. They camp by the entrance. Pjorg sees Flick go to pick up JL's stuff, \"Small one, allow me to bear that burden.\" Flick, \"Oh, well if you insist\" Flick says theatrically. Pjorg: \"WHy has your voice changed so?!\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance is hanging back with an eye to getting some of the Azurite. Drav picks up him and hoists him on her back. However, she feels a strange pull from Eldar back in the direction that Pjorg came from. \"Are you sure you don't want to explore the wall symbols that I saw?\" Drav, \"Oh yeah, we never talked about that. What Symbols are these, where are they coming from?\" Eldar: \"THey were inscribed on the walls, and they looked similar to some of those on the Ten-Axe archives, but it was clear that some exotic power was coming to them from behind the wall; from another source.\"</p>\n<p>Flick does not notice that Drav stops momentarily. She's not compelled magically, but is able to feel the pull of Eldar, who does not technically reside within her, but flits about vaguely.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg's understanding of Eldar is that she's sort of an imaginary friend. Drav hasn't revealed her existence to the rest of the party. The DM clarifies: An imaginary friend with very real effects. The ffects were detected in one circumstance, in a special area where people's subconscious could come to life (under the Xanthuc temples).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap knows the Xanthuc temples as the southernmost location on the map given him by someone at his village; the kobolds have made their way there from further to the west of the hellor mountains.</p>\n<p>Drav hews close to the rest of the group and runs to catch up. As she does so, she can hear the quiet rush of the river flowing below.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Long Rest finishes (about 150 feet away from Lhaska</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick attemps to recall the names of the cousins of the familiy who has a generational grudge against her (the McMurtons) .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WIS save KH. Flick CHA (11). Drav 23, JL 14, P 6 (did just wake up; not going to sleep).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav, JL, and Vengeance pass out. Flick isn't trancing any more. Pjorg's just awoken, essentially. As Flick is trying to recall the names of the McMurtons, she thinks back to the one boy lost in the woods, never found again, ... his name started with an \"S\". She can see his shape in her mind's eye, a totally black figure, surrounded by fog.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>INT save KH. 15.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The particular sheen of the darkness reminds her of the wolf figurine -- she's reminded of the way she sees the MP when she's in the EP. (Washed out and greyscale, out of focus. ) As this figure walks towards her, a dark green swampy woods materializes behind him, and instead of a three-dimensional rocky exterior, he begins to look like a hole through space. What she thought was a forest begins to look like creeping greyish green tentacles pushing through a hole in space. Flick fixates on his silhouette, and attempts to detect (the closest) planar portal (Detect Portal).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At first, though \"all signs point to portal,\" she's reluctant to assign it that; there's nowhere the portal goes, and then she recognizes that it has all the materials trappings of a portal, but seems almost like ... someone sent something to see if a portal could be made. Whatever the silhouette is made of. She can't tell the relationship between the tentacles and the \"portal\" assay. She then snaps out of the vision to see Pjorg polishing all the dust off his armor.</p>\n<p>As he's cleaning his armor, he notices that some of the runes he was looking at blasted away the dust in the mirror image of teh runes on his chest. Pjorg transcribes them and their proper orientation. He gets a section that, with attention from a specialist, he could puzzle it out. He spends the rest of the LR trying to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DC = 16? In the past, Pjorg is a memory-by-repetition, strength of mind, or stubbornness (will become constitution). Because he has 4 hours to examine 5 letters, he manages to determine the letters \"g-o-r-e-s\" (the spaces between the letters aren't in this runic alphabet)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg starts thinking of Bulls and the people gored by them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick keeps the watch since she's up. The all wake up at an appropriate time in the morning. JL has a bit of a hangover, but he's dealt with things like this before. \"Won't be the first time.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They examine the river gorge as we ...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cut to the surface and a wagon ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>being pulled by three stout ponies. It has embroidered on the outside &lt;&lt; insert my description here &gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>On the driver and shotgun position there are two gnomes: Nissi, wearing a deal of fussery, a five-piece suit made out of bright blue velvet with gold embroidery and a top hat. his horse strop is made from a strange purple leather with feather tassels on the end. Next to him sits another figure, Jaap. A small forest gnome, dressed practically, with greens and browns, with a big shield with the image of another weird gnome (Gaarl) on top of it; no hat. His hair is crazy, like most gnomes, as though he's just touched a tesla coil -- there's probably one around somewhere. He also has a beard. black hair and black beard. No silver hairs yet, because he's young for a gnome. his beard he quickly combed after touching the coil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap had been forbidden from entering the mobile toyshop, but the curtain separating the driver and the cab , which is usually black behind, this morning oddly enough betrayed a tesla coil, which Jaap had reached back to touch. Nissi slaps his hand, \"Hey, I said no going back there!\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: I had to have a look... Nissi: Looks like you've had a touch Jaap: how could you tell? Nissi: I'm wise where it counts</p>\n<p>Jaap is very tempting by what's in the wagon. Nissi points out various landmarks. \"Or maybe I'll drop you off a little earlier\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DEX KL.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nissi's been driving worrisomely close to the edge of the river gorge. He then takes a sharp right turn with the wagon, as if to jump it over the stream, much like Garl Glittergold in his \"Santaclause\" aspect. However, the wagon just begins falling and plummets down towards the river.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick and Pjorg, still up, hear the sounds of high-pitched screaming and look up to see a caravan catapulting over the edge of the river.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roll initiative</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance, distracted, tries casting slow fall, realizing too late that it's something that only affects him. \"If you just forget to fall ... ?\" Pjorg recalls one of the blasted dwarves named Digging Less Addams; they weren't liked by dwarves because they advocated for their first name.</p>\n<p>The river is about 200 feet below.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaap perception roll, 22</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as he tips over the edge, he can see a few people clustered in a cave opening about 60 feet below. There are isolated entrances that pockmark the cliff face, but two of the people have noticed him. He takes stock of things and Dimension Doors and pops onto the ledge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap reaches out to grab Nissi, and grabs one of his many frock coats; instead he's holding a full bottle and a deck of playing cards. \"I hope you enjoy your new friends!\" and plunged down with the wagon. Jaap sees the sly wink of his uncle, Jan, emerge from behind the face; he recognizes a classic gnomic prank.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: Classic, Jan. Thanks!</p>\n<p>As he plunges into the water, it looks like a bubble of air surrounds him and he begins floating back up north.</p>\n<p>\"Aw, sweet, I got some turnip schnapps?! That's totally my uncle.\" He recalls that Jan is very proud of his turnip farm and makes disgusting schnapps and other products from them. They have a very high alcohol content, and may have other properties; but in either case they are hand produced from his distillery. (Jansen Distilleries in Atkhatla) and you can smell it through the bottle (year-old swampy boots) \"Ah, now I'm getting homesick\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cards are Deck of Illusions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone sees a tiny gnome materialize while behind him drops a shop-sized wagon with ponies. Flick rushes over to see what happened.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arcana.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick sees the wagon explode on impact. But he doesn't see any dead animals or gnome. She turns back to Jaap. \"Hey, how is everyone? I'm doing great!\"</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Hello, verrrrrry small one.</p>\n<p>Jaap runs over and hides behind the dwarf. Whispering: Do you know there's a goblin here?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>retroactive Stealth check on dimension door appearance. very bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When he jumped in, he somehow managed to drop every item on his person; amulets and vials and weapons. He's there picking them up, heaping them onto his cloak and dragging them up behind Drav.</p>\n<p>Drav: What's ... going on here? (She notices immediately some generic clerical signs on Jaap). \"Hellowww... We just met this goblin a few hours ago. We don't know each other yet.\"</p>\n<p>Flick: Yes thanks we know there's a goblin did you come down here just to tell us that? Jaap: I was worried about you guys; these goblins can be pretty mean, you know. Pjorg: A goblin, where?! Hahahahahah.</p>\n<p>Pjorg seems amiable, if deluded. If it helps him fight, he can feel as big as he wants.</p>\n<p>Jaap's history with goblins is no personal history, but just general distrust. But gnomes do like dwarves as allies because neither likes goblins. (The Biterbig gnomes live close to dwarves, as do the Flundarst gnomes, who are up in the top layer, and dwarves are lower.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: Oh, ok, this seems not to be a problem, then.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>History checks all around. JL is barely awake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL has been dreaming of his family and past girlfriends as goblins for the past three hours. Not surprisingly, Pjorg doesn't know too much about them. Drav knows a great deal about goblins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg thinks to himself (goblins are actually the most honest, upright folk the world has ever seen; all of them are chaotic good, fighting for the good of the land)</p>\n<p>Drav knows that they have been conspicuously absent from this area of the continent; really anywhere east of the Ocean of Rel. There are legends as to why; some say there was a genocide, some that it was an exodus to head for a Cockayne/cocaine paradise. Flick knows there aren't very many around.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bathroom break</p>\n<p>Jaap INT check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that Jaap knows that Nissi was Jan, he thinks back to stories he was telling about the fantasy land he supposedly grew up in. The land of Milk and Honey, and he realizes that some of these things could have been hints to him about leads to pursue on his quest. Jaan did wonder why Garl hadn't been all that evident in helping him. - rumor about evil unicorns who would seek out virgins to consume their blood (hearts?) and sustain their immortality - legends of Kalarduan, who stole the heart of Ogremoch, and the theft caused the latter god to turn evil, but gave Kalarduan the power to control earth elementals. Jantien was never able to receive the welcome from the gods into the clerical faith; it's possible she might have pursued something similar - creatures that would steal the hearts of people in order to gain certain powers&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap reflects on how inventive his sister was. Flick's eyes flit between the wagon flotsam and Jaap. \"I think he's alright; he got away fine.\" It doesn't take a lot to convince Flick of things anymore. Drav is sleepy and doesn't understand anything that's going on.</p>\n<p>Flick: We do need a way out of these caves. JL: Oh yeah, we were not thinking ahead. (He's still processing returning). Flick: The snake cult must have gotten in somehow; can we go back out the way Pjorg got in? Drav: Oh yeah, I didn't mention, that eldar mentioned some runes in that direction. Pjorg: I ... oh, RUUUUUUUNES. I saw some runes. Upon a wall. I was studying them, attempting to discern their meaning, although it is laborious, and suddenly there was a brightness, and that is all I know.</p>\n<p>Very cryptic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg arcana check. boom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The runes he was studying are supposed to keep him awake, so it's really weird he fell asleep afterwards. they definitely don't have anything to do with inducing soporificness. which is like terrificness, but sleepier.</p>\n<p>Pjorg has drawn their copies, and people can see his actual runes carved into his armor and weapons. The dust is transcribed into a runic journal.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>INT kl. nat 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick can tell that these don't look like the runes on his weapons. As Drav suspects, they look like they are part of a grammatical language. It's not a language she knows. Is it a language Pjorg knows? Yes, it's very close to one ... he knows.</p>\n<p>Pjorg's runes are like sigils. The runes contain the essence of the thing that's being written, and that's what allows the thing to be ...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick commands the Rope of Climbing to wend its way up and knot itself to an outcropping on ground level. It takes about a minute. Flick, a good climber, lifts the part members up to the rope.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FLick turns to Jaap: Do you have business in this cave? What were you doing today? Jaap: whatever you're doing sounds like a cool adventure. Flick: We're going to get back a salamander from some con artists and see where the day takes us. Pjorg: Is this a normal day for you small ones? Flick: Kind of ? Jaap: and sandford is our destination? Flick: yep Jaap: Oh, I'd love to come with. Flick: We're a party of little people Pjorg: Indeed, save one. Drav: Isn't there a weight limit for this thing? Flick: I don't know, DRAV, is there?</p>\n<p>Flick thinks about daisy-chaining, then realizes she'll be holding everyone's weight, so jumps down and then agrees people should just get boosted up the rope.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where is Mule? As Jaap was tipped into the chasm, he saw across the way a contented Mule chomping at some sedge grass. The ponies nodded knowingly at it. Did it have a weird nose? Yes, it looked vaguely humanoid. Very vaguely. Shortened nose, humany-lips, a human soul poking out from its eyes. Oh, that must be another gnome (illusion?) then.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: Not a lot of people know this, but that Mule came rocketing out of a pool of greasy wrestling oil at us, and we invited it along on our quest. You, Jaap, might crack the top three for strangeness of circumstances Pjorg: I believe this is a rather DRAV (drab?) day Drav: I think the slime unicorn is top of the list.</p>\n<p>At the mention of a slime unicorn, Jaap perks up, as it sounds a lot like the strange unicorn Jan was telling him about. \"Oh, what about this unicorn, did you encounter it? Flick: Encounter it? we killed it Jaap: were there any virgins around at the time? Flick looks at Jean-Luc. \"Maybeee?\" JL: mmmmmmmmm (voice cracks) could happen</p>\n<p>Flick never attracted any interest from her age group and thinks of herself. \"Yeah ... there were some virgins around.\" Jaapn: So the unicorn was there for a reason then.</p>\n<p>Everyone is clinging successfully, even Pjorg, for whom the rope is too large a gauge. he used a smaller rope to tie to the bigger rope.</p>\n<p>The rope apparently responds to french: e lev tois (sp?) . and it pulls them up as it coils itself around the rock. They get their feet up the cliff and they kind of shuffle upwards without banging ; DRav and the smaller creatures can't quite make contact; Drav's feet are stabbing Vengeance in the face and shoulders as she basically stands on top of him.</p>\n<p>Sandford is south of them, on the western side of the river. They head south and look for a crossing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap can't think of any secret crossings.</p>\n<p>Though Roxfallanah is on the other side of teh river, Vengeance casts himself down and acts as though she's crushing him in the chest with her hooves. Flick: Hey Vengeance, let's get you over and make sure you can really do that. Pjorg: Tell me more of this brotherhood of oxidation. Vengeance: I am really doing it. Do I still have to whisper.</p>\n<p>Flick just summons Gerd to ferry them all across, and keeps concentrating on her for the 40 minutes it takes to get to Sandford. Flick uses her like a surveillance drone on the Hat Baskets. Jaap: Yeah, and we can see if there are any more wagons coming out of the sky.</p>\n<p>Nissi had taken a less explored route south on the east of the river.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick turns to Jean-Luc. \"Based on what you know of these folks, would we be able to find the Hat Baskets based on where they were last night?\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is Jean-Luc familiar with the Demerast Saga? (It bears the same relation to real thieves that Law&amp;Order does to actually being a homicide detective. It \"has the trappings of authenticity but is deeply ridiculous\") Yes, but it didn't bear any relation to why he chose thieves' work. (He's a romantic, but not like that. Jean-Luc would have read Demerast because it would have given him something to talk about with the women in his classes)</p>\n<p>The things about meetings in safe-houses is that, even if HB aren't actively using it, they are keeping an eye on it. JL thinks if they go there, because of the chaos, and explosion, it would \"bring up a lot of bad memories\" -- this is how the HB choose their safe houses. Also if Tishara has a lot of money to burn, she'd be in favor of conspicuous consumption, but there's a chance that some of their agents are still hanging around there.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How expensive is real estate in Sandford? Flick: Looking at your character sheet it doesn't look like you're proficient in commercial real estate. Michael: Yeah that was a tough choice. Mick: You could always work that into the character attributes. If the HB want to be close to the ports, there is a great deal of turnover in those properties, but it's also in high demand, so they could move outwards to the north-east; but it's a matter of meeting their requirements for accessibility, secrecy, and ostentation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL: Because they expect us to do a job for them, and/or set us up, we won't have to find them, they will probably find us. Flick: Fair enough, but I don't like being \"found\" in this context. Should we start from the former safehouse and see if there are breadcrumbs for us to follow? Are these crumb-bums careless enough? JL: I think they're capable, and security-conscious, enough that because this is their town, we will alert them if we go looking for them. We can't avoid hitting their trip wires. DM: They were pretty good at finding you initially, and it may also be that they're operating in an environment where they don't have any considerable enemies.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick: like the dodo, and we're the Portuguese. On the list of crimes, #1: Brazil. #2: the dodo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: there are two things we can do: try to track them down, or ready ourselves and conspicuously ask around for them. JL: we have one advantage, which is that we weren't accompanied by a goblin and a kobold. JAAP: excuse me! (Jean-Luc doesn't know what race they are, and doesn't care. \"I don't see kobold\").</p>\n<p>JL: we can use ourselves as bait and let our friends hide in the shadoes. Flick: I like that a lot; Pjorg is very adept at hiding, so I think this plan is great (presumably irony?) JL: if we go around looking for them, that will be suspicious. If we present ourselves openly Flick: We could pretend we did the job. JL: Yeah, the ledger wouldn't be too hard to forge. Flick: We could find some leather-bound book at some bookstore. Drav -- you probably even have something on hand. Drav: We should probably try to match what it looks like</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>they roll a 100 on 1d100 luck check for how well they remeber what it looks like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It looks like a large, weathered, leather-bound tome with brass bindings.</p>\n<p>They look for an antiquarian bookstore.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Montage music.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick: What if Pjorg and Jaap are sent into the bookstores? If we're being watched that might make most sense. JL: I want to believe I can convincingly lie about why I'm in a bookstore to other thieves. Flick: These are the people we had to fold their frickin map around a dagger. JL: it feels more like ornamentation rather than actual security. Pjorg: I have seen a hydra, and they are tremendous in their size. Jaap: it's a good idea; we probably don't want to be seen with the rest of the gang, then. Flick: This is getting very complicated. I think maybe we should just get the book, and JL will talk us out of it if we're caught. Drav: there's probably other materials we'd need too, wouldn't there be? Flick: we;ll need some filigree and carbolic acid to weather the pages.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carbolic acid, or phenol, is present in coal tar (from where it's primarily extracted), but also from the temporal glands of elephants in musth, and beaver castoreum, which is a great addition to anyone's cabinet of curiosities.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance: I've heard of phenols and carbolic acids mentioned in conjunction with the Order of Rust. Flick: You're still on that, huh? Vengeance: How not? It's what my childhood enemy devoted himself to. Flick fails in trying to convince vengeance to leave on a quest. Vengeance: Flick, your reverse psychology attempt to get me to stay has worked, I do declare. Pjorg:&nbsp;Vengeance: If the Order of Rust is about disintegration, then I want to integrate with you all by staying Pjorg: Isn't the order of rust very fiendish? Vengeance: Ok ... true ... Pjorg: then wouldn't they have already planned for this? Vengeance: They're fiendish, but they aren't all that smart Pjorg: or maybe they want you to think that. Vengeance: I don't know i've played mind games with them. Pjorg: They've bee doing that the whole time. Vengeance: Do you want to come with me? PJorg. Yes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deception KH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance: ok, so as long as you come with me? Pjorg: absolutely. here's the plan, let's split up. Vengeance: already going back to the Order of Rust structure of disintegration. Pjorg: I'm coming with you, but we're splitting up. Vengeance: Where should I be going ?</p>\n<p>[57::]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance lives with Roxfallanah</li>\n<li>Everyone thinks he gave up way too easily, maybe.</li>\n<li>Ledger, and what they need</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav arcana (11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Drav knows that there's an arcane fingerprint to the tome, but she's not positive that she can replicate it.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Flick: we just really need to get in the same room as them</li>\n<li>JL is upset most by why&nbsp;they&nbsp;are being involved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If they were able to make text appear on it in real time, as though it were coming from the captains, it would do a lot to sell the illusion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jaap: I think I have a cantrip for that.

JL to bar to act like he did the job.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick remembers passing Poor Souls' Salvation (book store, among other things); Fountain of Elegance. Flick heads there. (Another water feature like the caves)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL Performance/Deception check KH</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg is hiding; doesn't know how well goblins will be received. Flick thinks they should do the buddy system. Drav is also interested in what the Fountain would sell. Jaap goes to look around town; he's never been in a town like this before, just underground warrens.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaap Investigation nat 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sandford is a small town, only a mile in diameter. Bigger than anything he's seen; a curious distinction between social classes. Larger estates, crummy houses near docks; warehouse districts; open plazas. people milling about; there are quite a few strangers to town. it's in the middle of a fishing competition/contest/holiday .&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ian: is there a weighstation to see what's the biggest one? DM: Yes, one of the plazas set off specifically for sizing and weighing competition. Officiants with giant white moustaches that reach to their knees, and ancient rulers; metreticians to weigh them magically, and people expounding on symbolic and religious fishy values. Some fish are in ice; some people have brought giant aquariums.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Magnificent Sandford Menagerie Fishing Jostle</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap is into trickery, as a gnome, but hasn't used this spell all this often with strangers, and ends up shouting \"Hey buddy, watch it there\" and he can't sell the ventriloquism. Everyone looks at Jaap. The fish catcher: I am taking care of him; i'm gonna throw him back later. Jaap: Uhhhh ... well done, yes. Other guy: Look, there's funnel cakes and spun sugar. I'm sure that's good for a toddler like you. Jaap, embarrassed, moves away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With Nat 20, he sees these creatures that meet one of Nissi's description. Local pirates, maybe even raiders or slavers. If he didn't know better he'd think they were part fish. Their skin is thick, pale, and wet, almost like skin kept in wet boots for too long. They are ghouls, or ghasts, though, and live in the Sea of Kohsht. They make excursions up to Marshbout and teh Honeied sea, and take goods and valuables from religious institutions; they have slaves to build their ships, and cut wood, and sew sails, etc. This could have been one of the routes for his sister being taken. It's unusual she would have disappeared without a trace, since they usually do a lot of damage, and there are a few on the outskirts of one of the plazas; maybe they have an SEP around them.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are no police in Sandford, per se. Gnomes don't have police. There was a bailiff or constable, maybe, but no \"bureaucrats with guns\" .&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap pops into a wholegoods store and pokes out from behind a barrel full of olives. a customer looks at him quizzically but assumes him to be an employee. He casts Disguise Self to change his apperance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[Cut to]</p>\n<p>Flick and Drav in Fountain of Elegance; there is a fountain in the middle of the room, and through some gaudy magic there are rhetorical phrases being spewed out of the fountain, where it speaks the phrases as the water forms the shape of the words. The store is far too large for the few shelves it has, and there are even fewer books per shelf. Dispite all the room, the books are spine out, and it's clear they are going for some kind of arcane minimalism.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[:: back to full transcript]]</p>\n<p>There's no counter or desk, there's just a retail space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: Is this just a front? This doesn't look like a business meant to do business.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nat 20 (from before)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She's pretty sure that's exactly what's going on, and because it's so twee she's pretty sure it's the Hat Baskets too. \"Drav! This isn't a real bookstore, I think it's a front for the Hat Baskets\"</p>\n<p>As she looks around, she sees that the back wall, in the silhouette of a person, starts to become liquid, and out of it emerges a figure (reminding her slightly of the naiad), a polished greenish-blue skin, completely bald, piercing golden-brown eyes, wearing a well-tailored white dress, simple sandals. she comes forward.</p>\n<p>Flick: mam, do you happen to be responsible for this establishment. Oriax: Yes, this is my bookstore. We sell all sorts of rare artefacts here. 9She looks at both of them). You're not my typical clientelle. Flick: I was wondering. If you not only sold volumes but took them on consignment or trade. I happen to have a biography detailing the lives of certain captains of industry by an author D. L. Ledger and I haven't had much luck getting it appraised.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Flick has to restrain herself from tapping her nose, like the thieves stereotypes cliches).&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deception check? 18 (I should have done something like ... they both roll intelligence or Insight and the scores have to add up to a certain number?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oriax looks at Flick. Oh, DL Ledger. I was going to tell you that consignment here is -- I've hardly ever spoken the word. And emits a beautiful, bell-like laugh. Neither Drav nor Flick can tell what species she is, but she does seem humanoid. \"How many 'a's are at the start of your name?\" My name is Oriax.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick lapses into fey and speaks a fey idiom \"~ you never know what rock the golden worm will be under.\" She looks at Flick and laughs, \"Indeed!\" She has no idea what Flick has just said.</p>\n<p>Flick papers over that \"party foul\". \"I unfortunately don't have it with me; I left it in my rooms, but after your obligations are finished here perhaps you and whoever is interested in acquiring it could meet me at (she pulls out her map and points conspicuously at the dagger hole ) \" right here, for instance.</p>\n<p>Though the store is empty, Oriax looks around and pushes the map down out of sight. \"There's no need for that here -- I don't think that a tawdry meeting like that ; perhaps just keep it with you and you'll be found this evening.\"</p>\n<p>Flick: Marvellous, that's actually what I was hoping for all along. Oriax: In the meantime can I interest you in any of the wares I do sell. It looks like you travel in more elevated circles than I immediately assumed. Flick: The rarest of the rare, you have no idea. Drav, is the grimoire you're looking for among this selection? Drav: I've not seen it, but thank you. Flick (in fey):&nbsp;Dos vidanya, don't get any on ya'. Oriax looks haughtily baffled; oh, you elves and your wordplay Flick: let's get out of here, Drav.</p>"}

Rademacher</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having brought Flick safely to the Marshbout town limits, Joan shepherds her to the armory near the northeast watchtower. They are about to meet-cute Drav and Carlos at the entranceway when an agitated and aggrieved band of five humans pushes their way past them and into the building. Carlos stands by disinterestedly while the contact he had been sent to talk to, Constable Norman Barrelchest, attempts to impress upon this furious group his social superiority through enigmatic gesticulations and the distinct absence of suspenders (traditionally associated, in Marshbout, with the gentry). He is nevertheless pulled in their wake back up Plumb Highway (allegedly nominated because of its straightness). Carlos dolly-zooms in on a medical supply cabinet at the end of the infirmary as his kleptomania takes hold. After some hijinks, Joan thrusts herself in the mix, coming up with some much-vaunted suppositories and also a minor potion of healing, which she delivers forthwith to Carlos.</p>\n<p>Flick, too, takes full advantage of this opportunity to secure the attention of Darlyle (looking a bit overworked) and Rik Sandstone (looking a bit overdressed), the two medics. They are able to do what Carlos, in his infinite sadness, had been unable to accomplish; -- namely, point Flick to Lupenna&rsquo;s likely whereabouts in the visinage of Castle Karn on the Grey Tongue. Flick was not slow to point out Carlos&rsquo;s relative inadequacy, thus igniting the powerful cleric&rsquo;s deep-seated rage and commencing what would surely become one of the great rivalries the continent, nay, the world had ever known!</p>\n<p>Despite this newly minted drama, the four begin the miles-long trek to the Tongue. With confidence at its peak, and enjoying the plush tranquility of Thubutter Farrest, they are set upon by three plant-dogs affected by an inky evil seeping out of their eye sockets. The dogs, begging to be 'weeded', 'lawn'ch themselves at the travellers. Though the canids are handily dispatched (all of whom explod into clouds of ash upon death), Carlos is injured and laid flat during the fight. He is taken by a brief fit during which he suffers an ominous vision of a tunnel deep within the earth and a shapeless void moving towards him. However, perceiving that Carlos is not dead, Flick loudly boasts about her martial superiority, and the adventurers consider their options.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a64ce9c3-7fff-af0f-2c01-963af6e9169f\"></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>[partial recording]</p>\n</section>"}

I&rsquo;ve only recently learned how beautiful this particular world is. Most of my time is spent amongst the stars in outer space. I have seen other planets.</div>\n<div>- Flick: I can sent gaps in the fabric of spacetime that sent us away; do you sense any circles or portals to our southeast?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: I haven&rsquo;t yet been in that area. Unless these star motes have gotten the feel of a place, the areas are pretty murky for me. I have teleport circles back on my home worlds that I can use, but here it&rsquo;s pretty foggy.</div>\n<div>- [**] Flick reminds herself to listen out for anyone boasting of that kind of knowledge. The starmote dimms as she returns it to her bag of holding. Frustrated at her inability to skip all the boring walking &mdash;</div>\n<div>- Star: Flick, you have to remember to stay calm in the face of frustration. It does no good to get exasperated at small obstructions (obstructlettes). And &hellip; won&rsquo;t the journey itself be pleasant and enjoyable?</div>\n<div>- Flick: No, and maybe.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: It&rsquo;s your wise and insightful mind that can analyze these small distinctions.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Joan takes any spare moments to pore through arcane tomes and archaeological texts. Even though she was overburdened with her new certifications, it doesn&rsquo;t do her any good in the real world; now she&rsquo;s pursuing learning for its own sake. Flick commiserates outloud with this unspoken assertion.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Traveling west, the group skirts the north shore of Lavir&eacute; Lake. They leave behind them the smaller of the Goads, Mess, and turn their eyes to a strange island in the lake: a curious orange color, it&rsquo;s devoid of vegetation or built structures. It looks like it might have been blasted by a spell or hideous event. It&rsquo;s entirely flat and the surface sits just barely above the water level. Nor is it clear from what source Lake Goading is fed; the Nephil Mountains watershed goes straight to Snaff Bay. Maybe it&rsquo;s fed by underground streams or an aquifer.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: This place is pretty messed up, huh, guys?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They pass between Thubudder Forest and Pulldevil Grove (did devils pull people&rsquo;s arms and legs out, and give them life? or was it where the devil had his tail pulled, cast into Hell until he could recover his tail?) onto a level plain, in the far distance of which they see a prominent oxbow lake, a small town, and three conspicuous mountain peaks with ominous black shapes circling the apexes. (Or, perhaps the islands behind the peaks are still living volcanous spreading ash and rocks in small belches.)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The continue along a riverbank fed by marshes which propagate at the foot of the Braided Mountains. Flick and Drav consider returning to the gnoll village to wait for the peryton to show itself in the middle of its range. Flick pulls Vek out of its bag.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Thanks for the fresh air; it gets pretty cramped in there. You want to know what you have to do to unify the peryton and a succubus kiss? I would need to see the peryton up close, since I haven&rsquo;t done exactly this; if you were able to subdue her in some way I could probably pull it off; but if she&rsquo;s in a state of violence, I probably couldn&rsquo;t do it against her will. Usually the people who come to me are willing ascetics. pretty weak dudes, kinda like Hiero / Vengeance over here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Could you do it if she were unconscious?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yeah if you put her in a earthly concavity, sprinkle some dirt on us, allow me to sneak in there.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: metaphorically?</div>\n<div>- Vek (to Paros): You&rsquo;ve got quite a few extraneous spirits hanging around you.</div>\n<div>- Paros: no &hellip; well, they aren&rsquo;t extraneous.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Oh, cool, cool, I guess I&rsquo;m just not seeing the whole picture. &mdash; they weren&rsquo;t born with you, and they were never properly integrated. They might be Paros-itical. I&rsquo;m grasping for words here. You&rsquo;re a bit of a conundrum, spiritually.</div>\n<div>- Paros: is that a good kind of condundrum?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Sure, I like a challenge, or a puzzle &mdash; sure, it&rsquo;s a neutral term. &mdash; Great, so Flick, you&rsquo;ll just carry me in your arms from here on out, let me get some air.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: I could stick you on Mule, in one of the panniers.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Aw, sounds great, Mules are very close to the earth.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc and Paros appear skeptical at Vek&rsquo;s very nature.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: I can try really &hellip; really hard to make this jar look like a face. (Beetle exoskeletons slide into place as eyes and a dead earthworm makes its mouth.) &mdash;I&rsquo;m not hearing many compliments. All these creatures are dead, so &hellip; you should be pretty confident in me. (The creatures begin to slide to the bottom of the jar.)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick produces some fizzlecyst poison distillate to hand to Jean-Luc. Vengeance sees Flick passing something to Jean-Luc, probably a very high percentage alcohol beverage.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I hate to interrupt, but I think it would be best if I took that. I&rsquo;m actually quite parched and could use a drink. If you don&rsquo;t mind (and he goes to yoink it).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc bobbles the drink in going to protect it, and as it hot-potatoes among the three of them, Flick gets a firm hold on it. Flick backs up twenty feet &mdash;You really don&rsquo;t want this in your mouth! - Vengeance: Look, we&rsquo;re having fun here, playing fizzlesack, there&rsquo;s no need to drink it. Jean-Luc offers Vengeance a slug from the silver star bottle.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star comes over: Hey, y&rsquo;all aren&rsquo;t bogarting one of those drinks, are you? Maybe we should all get used to sharing and passing stuff around, you know?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc, still distrustful of the blue being, has no idea what Startrella is referring to, nor what her intentions are.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: No response? You get so weird off this stuff. Fine, whatever. It&rsquo;s not my place.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Excuse me for not trusting someone who&rsquo;s incorporeal and spirit controlling one of our friends.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: I&rsquo;m totally corporeal, look at this! (She begins fizzlesacking).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance starts fizzlesacking too &mdash;Yeah, Jean-Luc, look at this! You don&rsquo;t need to drink to have fun. Flick waits for an opportune moment &hellip;</div>\n<div>- Star: Vengeance, check this out, go long!</div>\n<div>&hellip; to give Jean-Luc the poison vial. Vengeance monkishly hyperextends his arms in an attempt to go long. &mdash;No, your feet! says Star. Use your feet!</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Oh, no, my feet are way too blistered.</div>\n<div>- Star: Well it&rsquo;s a lot like &hellip; you can use any part of your body but your hands.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: well my hands are the only part of my body that doesn&rsquo;t hurt right now. I guess I&rsquo;ll go back over to Jean-Luc.</div>\n<div>- Star: Ok, that&rsquo;s a little less cool, but sure.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Mule goes over and nuzzles at Drav, who pets her back.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Oh, she doesn&rsquo;t usually like dwarves! You see, the sorceress who turned her into a mule happens to be a dwarf herself.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: Really? Who was it?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I&rsquo;m a little fuzzy on the details myself. She&rsquo;s a dwarf. I was going to ask, since you have that book, which is written in dwarvish, is that correct? - I happen to be looking for a dwarf book, that tells of the creation of secret portals to the far realms. If you could keep a lookout, i&rsquo;d be most appreciative.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: Suuuuuuure.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: You two are talking about portals over here? It&rsquo;s a lot of portal talk for one day? Don&rsquo;t you ever just want to plant, enjoy what&rsquo;s around you. &mdash; The silent treatment? you guys on a bunch of grass?</div>\n<div>- Vek: No, they don&rsquo;t have grass, otherwise I&rsquo;d ask them to plant it in me. And see about turning Hiero into that oak.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: should we get going? I hate to be the most motivated one, but &hellip; it&rsquo;s getting a bit stale.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav considers a short rest; Flick suggests tending to Graal in some way so she can travel on her own. Fez comes over first; those who he passes expect to feel the warm, comforting, stimulating aura, but instead they catch the smell of dead fish and brine. Fez reaches out with one of his salves, rubs it on Graal&rsquo;s skin, but instead of healing her, the skin becomes black and rubbery. &mdash;It must be some kind of interaction with the necromancy? Maybe the oil went bad. Carlos comes over and meditates for a moment, reaches out and touches Graal; the rubbery flesh sloughs off, and there is healthy tissue underneath, which Carlos causes to heal over [remove curse + healing word] , but without restoration of the two missing limbs (on the right-hand side).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Sorry about that, Graal. You&rsquo;re very big.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Graal: I wouldn&rsquo;t have made it through the portal if I didn&rsquo;t lose those two arms. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can get these two arms back. We don&rsquo;t have four for nothing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Are you going to be ok out here?</div>\n<div>- Graal: Just heading back home, now. Are there any places that would welcome a slowly healing ape guardian.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Well there&rsquo;s Seomra Crann, but don&rsquo;t tell them we sent you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Graal: Heh. That&rsquo;s a common sentiment among the Girallon. It&rsquo;s considered polite not to mention who else you know as a shared friend.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: If they ask about a a sheriff and maritime law, just tell them the sentence has been carried out.</div>\n<div>- Graal: &mdash; Sure&hellip; i should be able to remember. But the road is safe?</div>\n<div>- Flick: Well it&rsquo;s mostly druids, so they should be able to help</div>\n<div>- Graal: Yeah, druids are pretty great. I like it when they sew flowers into your hair.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: What&rsquo;s that? Flowers in your hair? That sounds too good to be true.</div>\n<div>- Graal: Yeah, they&rsquo;ll put them anywhere &hellip; you have hair. which it looks like you don&rsquo;t have any of.</div>\n<div>- Star: Yeah, I like to keep it smooth; it&rsquo;s better for swimming and surfing.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: It&rsquo;s even more fun when they sew the flowers directly into your skin. so you&rsquo;re in luck my friend.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: Bro, first with the hand-saking, and the flowers sewn into your skin: are you in a body-mod cult or something like that?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Yeah, it&rsquo;s called the Mod Sqod, I think you&rsquo;d like it&mdash; you seem like a chill character.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: Totally right!</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Dope.</div>\n<div>- Star: you have some dope on you?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance gives Star some dothlarshian po&rsquo;otay.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Unfortunately it has to be injected directly into your eyeballs.</div>\n<div>- Star: huh, well i bet i can find a way around it with my starmotes. but &hellip; yeah, thanks. here&rsquo;s this.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A starmote travels out to Vengeance. It crystallizes into a large opal (worth about 50gp). &mdash;You&rsquo;re just full of surprises, aren&rsquo;t you? &mdash; Yeah, hey, take care of yourself. You gotta be careful with that bodymod stuff; sometimes you don&rsquo;t recover; or it can be like you&rsquo;re living out a traumatic past, that someone hung you up on hooks and tortured you. maybe find someone to talk to, or a chill crew.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: You remind me of some of my childhood. &hellip; and, hey &mdash; can you make more of these jewels?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: It takes something out of me each time. Tomorrow, sure, I could make another. Also, it&rsquo;s a lot easier if someone&rsquo;s just done me a solid. It worries me a little that you&rsquo;re bringing this up, since, in the past, my people have been milked for the ability to create jewels and jems out of their own bodies, so maybe don&rsquo;t bruit this about.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: like &hellip; they&rsquo;ve been killed with kindness?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: let&rsquo;s say, turned into living resources to extract money from.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: don&rsquo;t worry, i would never</div>\n<div>- Star: Yeah, no, I could tell, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of it.</div>\n<div>- Flick: This has happened to you?</div>\n<div>- Star: Not to me, no, and on this plane, but not on this planet. they made some kind of special astral plane prison or soul cage. this dragon over here probably knows about it, it&rsquo;s been written about in the history books. oh and probably these two, too. Drav and Parlos? they seem bookish.</div>\n<div>- Flick: so there might be something written about it?</div>\n<div>- Star: well it happened on this plane, so i don&rsquo;t see why not; but it&rsquo;s possible some kind never got a chance to be written about. history is written by the winners. it&rsquo;s heavy stuff.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: who did this?</div>\n<div>- Star: well, there&rsquo;s a group called the githyanki, and some are chill, and some tour around in battleships to look for loot and treasure. people think it was either them, or they were part of this slaving trade route, that they would provide people to those who wanted them.</div>\n<div>- Flick: did this happen to you? or are you relaying a oral history?</div>\n<div>- Star: no, i &hellip; read about it. but i remember the stuff you need to remember, like where&rsquo;s the best po&rsquo;otay, and who&rsquo;s the chillest gang, and how to depillate yourself</div>\n<div>- Flick: were any of those people Fiends or creatures from the lower planes?</div>\n<div>- Star: you don&rsquo;t mean like Macky &ldquo;The Fiend&rdquo; Matrakalis? that guy could run a town red. if you got on his train, man, you weren&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; home for a week. He was something.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: tell me about it, man.</div>\n<div>- Star: You knew Macky?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: well, we kind of rolled in the same circles. for a little while. we weren&rsquo;t close friends or anything. but i know the legends.</div>\n<div>- Star: now that I think about it, that makes a lot of sense. he was totally into getting inked up and all sorts of shit. if you&rsquo;re into body mod, it&rsquo;s totally possible you ran into each other.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: he did some stuff that even I shudder to think about.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: even you? you&rsquo;ve told me some things just today that made me wretch a bit, but in a good way,&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: is there any other way?</div>\n<div>- Star: ahaha, but yeah, there are bad ways. i start spewing out black holes and neutron stars; you have to stay out of the way; if i&rsquo;m with people like yourself, you have to stay out of the way. plus i&rsquo;m unconscious at the time.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: i&rsquo;d really like to see that</div>\n<div>- Star: you&rsquo;re asking a lot of me right there, &mdash; i can&rsquo;t make opals for a month after one of those. i&rsquo;m just shitting out fiery nebulae for the next couple weeks.</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: how did we get here?</div>\n<div>- Star: you were passing around some sweet liquids, and I wasn&rsquo;t invited to partake.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick tries to get Aphelia&rsquo;s attention and asks if she feels anything when she looks at the black shapes moving around the peaks.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: they look like &hellip; remind me of the simurgh, you know, the bird on top of Seomra. the way it moves, it&rsquo;s fluid. i&rsquo;m not an ornithologist, and actually, my eyesite is poor, i&rsquo;m sort of a close-seer from playing instruments, but i can&rsquo;t _feel_ anything at this distance.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: bear in mind, i&rsquo;m in way over my head here. I was mostly wondering if there is any affinity between you and calliope that would resonate over long distances.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: well if there&rsquo;s any way to create a low-frequency resonance over that distance.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: you said some beasts can do it; &hellip; could a bear? &mdash; I&rsquo;m reasonably certain that the cauldron from Shoemaker will let me turn into a bear. it does seem like i&rsquo;d have to recharge it after use, but I offer that as a solution.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: can i see the helmet?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc [insight on aphelia/star: thnks Star could be modifying her message a bit?]. &mdash;Promise to give it back! Aphelia brings the helmet over to Graal, who touches it, at which point it increases to Graal&rsquo;s head&rsquo;s size, and Aphelia blows over the opening. Soon the sound drops so lo frequency and it can&rsquo;t be heard. Flick disappears into the tree-line and readies her bow. After a few minutes, Aphelia perks up, brings the helmet back to Jean-Luc.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: I was able to create that sound; and yes, the peryton is there, and so are, i believe, her young .I got a very evil feeling from small, unformed creatures surrounding her.</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: That&rsquo;s how we do. So you know where the peryton is.</div>\n<div>- Aphelia: yes, she&rsquo;s on top of the tallest peak, facing us. &mdash;and gives Jean-Luc a kiss on the cheek.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez is out in the woods; Cyrowan comes over &mdash;Boy you got a kiss from a girl, how exciting!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: yeah, not everyone can be as irresistible as I am.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: boy oh boy you certainly are a good looking handsome oman, and a voice that hardly ever cracks.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Just eat your vegetables and eight hours of sleep each night, you&rsquo;ll get there.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: is that it?</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: well, and study &hellip; and listen to Fez.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: sure thing; i know we&rsquo;ve been on rations here but maybe Flick&rsquo;d find me some herbs? (oh man, a kiss on a cheek, what a day, i&rsquo;ll never forget that one.)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick recaps the &ldquo;seven layer grift&rdquo; employed to get Aphelia out of Seomra Crann. (Jean-Luc, as sheriff, declared that Flick stole a brewery&rsquo;s IP-A).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2 id=\"thenextmorninglongrest\">the next morning (LONG REST)</h2>\n<div>Fez looks awful. &mdash;I kept trying to sleep but I had nightmares that I was trapped in a sea tempest, and then I would drown, and wake up, and the cycle would recur. It felt like I was being pulled under the water by something I couldn&rsquo;t see or feel. Drav inspects the halfling and comes to the conclusion that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; by 1 level and did not receive the benefits of a long rest.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: when did you start feeling this way?</div>\n<div>- Fez: I feel great all the time! (but he&rsquo;s been weary since emerging from underground)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick recalls that Fez had a converzation with Abzu, a kraken, who had said that Fez made a contract with it to survive, when some of Vek&rsquo;s soil spilled into the conch. Fez said he didn&rsquo;t want any part of that. Since that, his efforts at healing have been largely unsuccessful. Flick tells everyone that a lot of calimari is pig anus. Or an elder beaver god named vanilla. The team realizes they can&rsquo;t do anything to help Fez out in the long term.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Waking up, Jean-Luc can hear the noise of a wagon from about 1/4 mile away, accompanied by a few creatures, heading towards them from the north. It&rsquo;s not clear where they&rsquo;ve come from, other than &ldquo;north&rdquo; - perhaps the braided mountains or thereabouts?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>(For most of their time on the road they were headed west-east. two humanoid creatures walking along a cart. The cart/wagon looks like the ones they saw in the Forests of Horth, and it&rsquo;s being pulled by a very large humanoid. ) Flick suggests continuing on without intercepting the caravan, and Jean-Luc expresses agreement. True to her analytical exhaustion, though, Flick describes the attack of a similar caravan group when they were transported to Horth.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: If anything it means they&rsquo;re in trouble, and we should continue on our way</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: they&rsquo;re probably just highwaymen, and we should avoid them</div>\n<div>- Paros: We should go meet them!</div>\n<div>- Drav: I&rsquo;m all for continuing to head south. Altho &hellip;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I&rsquo;m thinking of trying to sell them Startrella, who&rsquo;s somewhat of a golden goose.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: &ldquo;golden goose,&rdquo; yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly what I was trying to think of the other day.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They determine that Startrella is a (non)binary star system, so mas changing gender pronouns. Flick suspects they might be able to find a book about it later.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: any guy strong enough to pull a full wagon is someone we don&rsquo;t want to tangle with.</div>\n<div>- Paros: I&rsquo;m sure at least Joan could pull a wagon. Not that she would want to.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They see that it&rsquo;s a wagon which is meant to be pulled by a creature; it looks almost more like a wheelbarrow.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: maybe they attacked some merchants, but how do I know that the merchants didn&rsquo;t deserve it.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Jeanluc we&rsquo;re about to undertake a perilous adventure. Do you think we should trade and get supplies, or kill them and get experience points. (the offbeat meritocratic ranking system that prevailed at the monastery). we haven&rsquo;t upgraded our weapons in a while. who knows what foes may await us in these mountains.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I see no harm in stopping to stop to them.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick, flabberghasted at Vengeance&rsquo;s uncharacteristic reasonableness, decides also to talk to them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The approaching group is traveling at a walking pace, and their arrival estimated at five minutes. Flick, seeing Fez in such a bad way, thinks about the weird incel Cyrowan (incyrowan), and commits to watching closely the drippy human whenever he&rsquo;s within 20 feet of fez. Paros wonders aloud at this, and Flick declares that something is off about him, and that he came from underground, which is enough to be skeptical of him. Paros doesn&rsquo;t remember anything interesting from the Xanthuc temples because he was tied to a sled being pulled by Mule.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance remembers that he&rsquo;d carved the name of the dwarven sorcererr Amabelle into his skin. (and her stylishness)</div>\n<div>- Star: did you say amabelle? well she used to run with the fiend; she was a tatoo artist and she did his first tats, and they started running together. she&rsquo;s a real legend in the biz; her tattoos could do pretty much anything. stuff as far as healing people, or giving them really big appetites, just a huge puff of some sweeet grass; she could eliminate a hangover if she wanted.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I can&rsquo;t believe how small a world this is. she was basically under my nose this whole time, if she knew the Fiend. if i could find the Fiend I could get to her. but it&rsquo;s a shame that he&rsquo;s dead.</div>\n<div>- Star; it is too bad. it&rsquo;s too bad he couldn&rsquo;t live up to his namesake and live forever in the underworld, but we all have to embrace the cycle of life.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: he really went out with a bang, being thrown into that volcano.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Star: yeah some people say that everytime you breathe in a little bit of ash, from your stogie, that you&rsquo;re breathing in the Fiend. and i love that view, that he&rsquo;s impeding my breathing a little bit and could one day cause my death through the growth of cancerous flesh. it&rsquo;s a really great thing to look at things. and what you say about the world being small, this planet for sure is really small. i got a look at the world&rsquo;s blue book, and there&rsquo;s only, say, maybe 500 to 600 of them , but other worlds, they have millions. i mean, like, entities.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Paros has no idea who Startrella is somehow. Star passes off redescribing himself to Paros.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: i really liked graal; can you imagine how many swords she could wield at once.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The caravan comes into view. They appear to be hobgoblins, and the one is clearly very very large but still hobgoblin in shape if not size.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: i&rsquo;m not sure i want to give them startrella anymore; we&rsquo;ve kind of bonded. i&rsquo;m not sure what i&rsquo;ve gotten us into.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: how about we all come out of the trees so they don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re trying to ambush them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc stands in the middle of the road with a friendly wave. The huge hobgoblin looks like it&rsquo;s been carved from wood, and has terrifying white eyes (a hobgolem if you will, says Flick, bragging of her intelligence) . the one on the west shouts out &ldquo;and who be there!&rdquo;</div>\n<div>- flick : travellers looking merely to trade news of the road.</div>\n<div>- Glug: which way are you going?</div>\n<div>- flick: towards the mountains.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: and what pace might you be keeping? should we go ahead or stay behind?</div>\n<div>- Flick : as fast as we can</div>\n<div>- Glug: our pace is limited here by Udrek. (grunts)</div>\n<div>- Flick: your companion is &hellip; i&rsquo;ve never seen anything like him. what is he and how did you find each other</div>\n<div>- Glug: yes, hes almost one of a kind. we grew up in the same town; you&rsquo;d consider it a town; for hobgoblins it&rsquo;s almost a city.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: i kind of wanted to know, is why is he so huge</div>\n<div>- Glug: it turns out if you don&rsquo;t limit the growth of certain hobgoblins they can grow illimitably large. he&rsquo;s only six months old</div>\n<div>- Paros: oh so he&rsquo;s like a Gold Fish</div>\n<div>- Glug: he&rsquo;s certainly worth his weight in gold, and has the eyes of a dead fish, but those qualities belie a quite active mind.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick : Udrek, how does this day find you, if I mind you.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Day. Today. Warm. Arms Strong. // Ever thought. How. Universe. Infinite?</div>\n<div>- Star: yeah man, the universe is so big it&rsquo;s hard to get your mind around. this Udrek, he&rsquo;s definitely got smarts.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Agree. With. Blue. Lady.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&lt;&lt;The gang pauses.&gt;&gt;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: what do you have in your wagon, guys. When we saw you on the road we thought we could trade with you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: mostly we do wholesale; we&rsquo;re bringing some goods down to the coast. we get money from the owners of the ships, and they take our goods and try to make a profit. It&rsquo;s really just &ldquo;fine&rdquo; commodities.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: so you&rsquo;re middlemen?</div>\n<div>- Glug: you could call us that&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: what sort of commodities do you trade in?</div>\n<div>- Glug: high-value metals and gems; as to middlemen &mdash; we do most of the sourcing ourselves; we find these things on ancient or more recent battlefields.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: you&rsquo;re scavengers!</div>\n<div>- Glug: that&rsquo;s a bit of a slur, but i think not entirely inaccurate.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (remembers) growing up around cressida, it lies &hellip; just north of the town where i grew up, the border had been fought over by smaller kingdoms constantly in centuries past, and there was a lot of this kind of unsavory trade. as individuals, turning up whole pieces of metal from ages past, they were alright, but it left a bad taste in my mouth).</div>\n<div>- Paros: can we take a look at some of the stuff you&rsquo;re trading?</div>\n<div>- Glug: it&rsquo;s a kind offer, but we do have contractual obligation to meet weight requirements witih the wholesalers. we were right at the limit when we got all this stuff together. anything less and we&rsquo;d have to renegotiate.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: if there&rsquo;s something of value and little weight &hellip;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: we&rsquo;re a bit vulnerable to an assault, but we like to keep a low profile. you looked trustworthy enough.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros: it may be to your advantage.</div>\n<div>- Glug: typically, disagreements this sophistical we leave to Udrek to sort out in his massive woody mind, a nice &ldquo;pithy&rsquo; answer as to whether or not it would be worth. but we&rsquo;ll just proceed to the coast if it&rsquo;s all the same to you.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>(Flick wonders how battlefield scavengers are finding gems, but can&rsquo;t quite get a read on Glug. However, Paros&rsquo;s knowledge of history, knows that a lot of hobgoblins claim resources that are other peoples; either throught military might or subterfuge; these could be ill-gotten gains, but not all hobgoblins operate that way. they might not be &ldquo;old&rdquo; battlefield finds; but they could scavenge from recent battlefields, or other hobgoblins, or they could be highwaymen.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>(Can Paros&rsquo;s eye see residual emotions left on the items of previous owners. &mdash; he would have to be able to see the object. Instead, he casts &ldquo;detect thoughts&rdquo;)</div>\n<div>[- maybe i&rsquo;ll let him cast detect thoughts from the eye; like it gives him an extra slot for certain spells]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Able to step behind a rock, Paros surreptitiously screams and clutches his brain, beseiged by an infinitude of inner spirits, disguising the fact that he&rsquo;s casting a fairly commonplace spell. &lt;&lt;&lt;Udrek is engaged in hypercomplex mathematical equations about economy. Glugranok is getting a little impatient but still seems confident and self-assured. &gt;&gt;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc can see that there is bast or stuffing coming out of the crates; given how heavy on the wheels it&rsquo;s lying, and how hard Udrek is pulling, can gather that there is a lot of metals or minerals. it&rsquo;s probably not raw materials, or they&rsquo;d be doing it in larger quantities. they are probably &ldquo;goods&rdquo;, not bricks of ore. Paros tries to press deeper with Detect Thoughts on Glugranok, who surprisingly pushes the probing psyche out of his mind, ending the spell. Paros is able to tell that something else is aiding the spell&rsquo;s defeat, not just the hobgoblin&rsquo;s innate wisdom.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Glug: ok, well if you&rsquo;re moving swiftly &mdash; we don&rsquo;t want to encounter each other again &mdash; we&rsquo;ll just post up here and wait for you to move on?</div>\n<div>- Paros: you&rsquo;ll never meet anyone who&rsquo;s as comfortable with awkward as am i</div>\n<div>- Flick: Udrek, um, what&rsquo;s in the cart.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Finished. Goods.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc (to party): well if these fine gentlemen don&rsquo;t want to sell their wares, perhaps we should be on our way.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Udrek, why did you leave the rest of them behind?</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Friends. With. Me. Here.</div>\n<div>- Flick: I saw the rest of your caravan.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: What? Just this cart I pull.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: ok, Glug, quite far to the north of here i saw the remains of a caravan i&rsquo;d be very surprised to find you&rsquo;re not a part of. who wanted this stuff so badly they were willing to kill for it?</div>\n<div>- Glug: we came straight from the Braided Mountains. How much further north was it?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>(He&rsquo;s telling the truth from coming from the Braided Mountains. But why are they pulling the same kind of cart? And _what_ had been pulling Ox&rsquo;s cart?)</div>\n<div>- Paros: It must have sucked to pull the cart for such a long time.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Like. Diversion. From. Brain.</div>\n<div>- Paros: have you tried whiskey?</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Whiskey. Depressant. Need. Body. Simulated.</div>\n<div>- Vek: heh Flick what&rsquo;s this guy talking about. i heard something about a body. stimulus.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick runs over and grabs Vek off Mule, holding him on her hip like a laundry basket. ``&mdash;There&rsquo;s something seriously strange about the guy with the cart. Can you tell anything about whether his consciousness is supposed to be in his body?``</div>\n<div>- Vek: you&rsquo;re gonna have to get me a bit closer. From here he looks like he&rsquo;s properly &hellip; woven &hellip; his body is massive and treelike (again, Vengeance might want to get in on this), but looks like a perfectly normal creature. But like his eyes look a lot like the face i was making for you guys, with the dead beetles &mdash; remember? &mdash; i feel like i was basing it off a pretty handsome template. look at this hobgoblin: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a big handsome hobgoblin!&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[History from Drav 20 and Flick 18]. Drav, would know that there have been skirmishes between Longbeard, Broadbeam, and Greyknuckle clans. however, the areas under those clans, and up northwest, they are rumored to have hobgoblins; what&rsquo;s strange is that the hobgoblins almost never work with humans from Cressida, but the guy Ox you saw yesterday was human. It would be strange for them to be working together, but at the same time hobgoblins do have access to both sides of the mountain because their tunnels run. and they are using old dwarf tunnels that the dwarves left or been forced out of.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc believes that, even if they&rsquo;re scavengers carrying out a contract, that&rsquo;s just the world we live in.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: we&rsquo;re going to head south, and we won&rsquo;t take up anymore of your time.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: oh, no, I&rsquo;m sure Udrek wouldn&rsquo;t mind a break. (they grab some provisions from the cart and start eating them &mdash; mostly jerky, biscuits, light ale, which Udrek eschews. The hobgolem almost seems to root himself securely in the soil. )</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick examines the large creature again: was he pleading with them? is he under duress? Flick doesn&rsquo;t detect that Udrek is resistant to manual labor. Drav, acquainted with minerals, detects a glint of metal from the hairline of Udrek and Glugranok. Neither is wearing a helmet; but they do both have long hair. Remembering the advanced roboticism of dot-dot, they wonder if the &ldquo;hobgoblins&rdquo; are actually cyborg for a brief moment. &ldquo;Organiborgs!&rdquo; Paros shouts out.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Paros uses his third eye; [charisma check with advantage (DC 17)] there is some kind of mind control going on, the two guys in the front. The lady in the back is now hiding behind the cart. He does a crazy dance in the field attempting to disguise a sequence of message cantrips cast in tandem informing the party. Vengeance gets a little jealous.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: hey could you teach me some of those moves?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Yeah Paros, I haven&rsquo;t seen Fez do anything like that. you look like a dance master.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Paros (reluctantly): yyyy&hellip;eah</div>\n<div>- Udrek: What. Dancing. Business!</div>\n<div>- Glugranok: Is this how you all get started on a journey?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: what ho, friend! your companions have introduced themselves. we haven&rsquo;t had the pleasure.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Nerch (hiding behind the wagon): Meeeeeee? awhy are you laughing??&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: come on out</div>\n<div>- Nerch: I have very delicate skin.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav tries unsuccessfully to sneak up parallel with Nerch.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Glug: your dwarven friend here seems to be lost. I thought we&rsquo;d agreed you&rsquo;d head south.</div>\n<div>- Drav: Just admiring the stones here.</div>\n<div>- Glug: Oh, I can tell you quite a lot. I&rsquo;ve devoted a great majority of my life to studying the stones in the braided mountains.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav can&rsquo;t get a good sightline on Nerch with all the trees in the way. &mdash;What about the stones?</div>\n<div>- Glug: we&rsquo;ve taken over some of the old tunnels that were abandoned in the day, and so I like to fancy myself a dilettante, we could expand the tunnels; hobgoblins need a bit more vertical space underground than dwarves. i&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit about gems and metals. it also helps my work when we go around the battlefields extracting those things left behind.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Paros hypothesizes that perhaps these mind control effects are why Detect Thoughts didn&rsquo;t work. He and Drav can&rsquo;t figure out why the metal is so familiar to them. The color, though, is a reddish-gold. not like Paros&rsquo;s bracer. Flick by now has been alerted to the circlets; she approaches closer, around the wagon, to try to engage Nerch &mdash; she finds her shyness highly suspicious.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: you said your skin is really delicate. this wagon isn&rsquo;t covered: it&rsquo;s not keeping you out of the sun.</div>\n<div>- Nerch: you can see that the sun is coming from the south-west; if i take cover here under the corner it won&rsquo;t affect me as much. And you can feel this terrible wind passing, can&rsquo;t you? it&rsquo;s much nicer to be on the leeward side of Udrek here.</div>\n<div>- Udrek: Leeward. Cover. For. Nerch. Pleasure.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Nerch is wearing a robe over light leather armor and carrying a staff.&nbsp;</div>"}

Sandford on the north shore, and a cluster of small villages that attend the projectionsi and island in the bay. (They are repeased<a href=\"Reassured.\">^repeased</a> to know that their companions should be safe there in the pretty sleepy villages.) [History] (Jean-Luc has a reliable contact, his fence, \"Spindler,\" (who does not know Jean-Luc's real name either) lives on the village on the far side, the larger and more urban of the collective-of-four. Spindler sells things to an underworld boss known as The Jaguar. All except Flick know that the city is known for its experimental artificers and laboratory technicians -- perhaps they have contacts at Red Fox University? -- and suspect that tentamens[^tentamen] involving audio technology to direct undesirable soundwaves, or visuo-hallucinatory images such as scarecrows hundreds of feet tall, may protect them from the peryton and perhaps the tripods and other constructs. On the other hand, they may have been able to harness the power of naturally occurring geological magic such as lode stones or ley lines to the same purposes.

Flick approaches one of the homesteaders. She gives a general description of the Peryton, and that a village to the northwest hired us, and she's wondered if they've had livestock or people disappearing, and if they've seen this thing casting a shadow over their lands. The human farmer: \"It took my uncle the other week. No one particularly liked him: he was always asking for flour and sugar, we had to loan him money for his gambling; we kindof thought it was karma, but it does sound like more people who have even well-loved relatives are reporting that the bodies or organs are being taken. We know it as The Violet Shadow.\" Flick communicates with her sheepdog, Belavert, \"sounded like a glider, and it didn't scare me at all.\" Then it runs around everyone and sniffs them. Flick gives it some jerky, and it asks for more, and then offers to herd their sheep. \"Has the peryton been harassing livestock?\" \"It hasn't gone after my sheep; its shadow has passed over me and it didn't scare me at all!\" Flick detects a bit of bluster in the dog, and offers some fizzlecyst jerky to the farmer: \"This isn't going to make up for losing a hand around the farm, but I want to thank you for your time.\" \"Oh, is that some of that cave jerky -- thanks, I guess.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Vengeance: And if you're lying to us, we're going to come back, burn your house down, and kill everyone you love.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Ignore him.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Farmer: It looks like he needs a shower and a haircut.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vengeance: It's my standard farewell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Farmer: Farewell to you too, shore.

[Perception] Across the way they see a ramshackle building set back into one of the armpits of rock. There might at one point have been active paths leading to it, and they can still detect a trod path leading around the lake.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: Should we make camp here first?

For you to reunite them?</li>\n<li>Vek: It's preferable that, if the peryton doesn't want this, that it's unconscious and buried in some dirt that's conducive to me infiltrating me with my spirit. Aphelia should be pretty close to that dirt. Anything more than that I'll have to strain a little bit.</li>\n<li>Flick: Ok guys we might end up having to fight this thing. We want to catch it when it's roosting, so we should head up now, but I'm really curious about this lake hut.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: if anyone needs a healing hand, i've been using this severed hand as a backscratcher.</li>\n<li>Vek: What's that now? (and some interrogative dirt goes flying out of the vase)</li>\n<li>Drav: at some point we will need to rest for health and spells.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Turns out Carlos had healed them somewhat before they separated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flick: let's check out this shack, and maybe we could rest a spell and have aphelia play us a soothing saraband.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>They come around to the shack, with a shingle announcing Stato's Den. From the outside it looks like it was probably a bar, possibly for miners. Flick hypothesizes that there are mineshafts in the mountain. Jean-Luc would know that the mountains were mined for precious minerals and metals. Definitely gold and silver; rumors that they were mined for certain gemstones valuable to sorcerers. Jean-Luc had thought that people had abandoned the mines here 10-20 years ago. Obviously there are still scavengers who come in, but organized mining has stopped.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-Luc: Sometimes corporate packs up quickly enough that there's a few bottles left lying around.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc steps into the bar. Flick looks for a way to enter stealthily [13]. Flick is off today. The door creaks on its hinges; you peek in and see a ramshackle bar with a few tables. There's a squat stone statue in the corner, and a man behind the bartop leaning against the frame of a door leading into a back room. [Is it creepy? because the last time we walked into a nice bar there was unpleasantness.] Flick remembers from her youth a story of a dog sitting at a burning table saying to itself \"This is fine.\" But everything here seems cool. Flick knocks on the door, \"Hey there, you open.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: Erm, yeah, we're open. It depends what you want from us. Just beer?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc thinks, \"Ah, my people.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: It also depends on what you're willing to spend.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc walks into the center of the bar [Investigation low]. He sees that there is no \"top shelf\" of alcohol, there's just beer taps. The person behind the bar is human or half-elf, vaguely like Vengeance, with a receding hairline, wearing loose tattered red robes with dirty brown tunic underneath. They won't make eye contact, and they have a fleshy, undercooked, pale face.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beer it is! says Jean-Luc.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I like this guy's style. I'll take one as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Palchin grabs four stone-carved mugs and &hellip;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: has this bar been following us?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>&hellip; Flick sits down and joins Jean-Luc. Mule stays outside with Joan, but Aphelia comes in. Palchin delivers the drinks. [Perception] Drav and Flick can tell that the beer looks and smells like pure lakewater. Flick and the others sip at it. Jean-Luc has acquired a sophisticated palette, there was that one time the Gaol Maidens hazed you and took you through a fish market and made him drink the fish slurry. Vengeance, all the times your parents would do nearly the same thing and dunk his head underwater during a fishing trip. There is the homeopathic memory of fishiness to the water. But, oddly enough, it is moderately alcoholic. [Insight - is this malicious?] Flick, \"This very subtle piscine allure evades me.\" (Flick associates the taste with the stone). Jean-Luc knows that, not only is this what's usually served, but it's also as alcoholic as a beer. Flick <em>sotto voce</em> \"What the fuck is this?\" Jean-Luc: Alcohol can be distilled from different animals; they made it from fish. I've had worse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: There's certainly no greater compliment than having it said of one's beer that someone has \"had worse.\" If I could shake the hand of the man who said that.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc reaches out his hand. As he goes to shake his hand, Palchin's tray spills a bit of lake water onto the Lydia sword. (\"No big deal; things get a little splashed.\", and goes to wipe it down. - It looks a little duller in places, but nothing to worry about. But on second glance, it almost perfectly matches the water spots.) Jean-Luc whispers to Flick, \"Maybe stop drinking; something might be up with this guy.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: DO you happen to have a swish-bucket? Something that I can spit out into? I like to swish it around in my mouth a little bit, make sure I'm getting all the notes.</li>\n<li>Palchin: All the 'notes'? You think this is some sort of musical beer?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I'm detecting a bit of sturgeon, perhaps some pike -- what kind of fish are you using exactly?</li>\n<li>Palchin: FIsh? no, we use the mountain lakewater here to brew the beer. If you can detect that, you have a very sensitive palette.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I grew up with fish, and they have a familiar taste to me.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Oh, a kindred fisherman. I grew up fishing too. I just assumed that that smell sticks to you and affects everything you taste and smell from then on.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I'm no fisherman. It's kind of you to say that.</li>\n<li>Palchin: then why do you have all these fish hooks stuck into your fingers?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I had forgotten about those. This is a little bit of ornamentation.</li>\n<li>Palchin: We don't go for that sort of urban decoration around here. Just bread and beer folks. When you're in the mines, you don't want any extra metal on you. you never know if a spark could turn you into dust.</li>\n<li>Flick: You're talking like mining is still going on.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Mining, yeah. ALl the miners still come in after their shifts for drinks.</li>\n<li>Flick: I was going to ask why you were still here. We've been sent to investigate a presence casting a dark shadow over this mountain. [Insight 16]</li>\n<li>Palchin: Shadowy presence? No, definitely not. (His eyes dart back and forth; he's hiding something, certainly.)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Flick is distracted by the smell of stonefish and looks down just as Palchin's eyes betray him. Vengeance sees small divots in the wooden flooring where it's worn through to the mountain rock (that he could use as an expectorative receptacle). Jean-Luc is certain that this is not part of any criminal syndicate, outpost or not. This guy might not even know that some of the major recent historical events have occurred.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: is this all you want?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance goes to spit the swished beer into Palchin's &hellip; mouth! Perhaps luckily, the attempt goes past his face. \"Well if you don't have a spittoon I'm not sure where I should be spitting. I apologize; I haven't been out in the real world for a while.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: spitting in this place indicates that you despise the brew, or are about to get into an altercation</li>\n<li>Vengeance: On the contrary , it means I'm trying to appreciate the symphony of flavors. I'm trying to keep my palette clean and my head clear.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Oh so you really need a palette cleanser. &hellip; This reminds me of an incident from my youth, in which a distillery nearby was offering samples; I took a swig and spat it back into my tasting cup. I was then forced to drink my own backwash. It's only because of that incident that I'm excusing your lack of decorum</li>\n<li>Vengeance: That's gross, why would you even tell us that</li>\n<li>Palchin: I thought I would find an empathetic ear in you but i haven't.</li>\n<li>Flick (to no one): yet more disdain for the working class amongst the adventuring bourgeoisie.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>He brings back to Vengeance a bowl full of dried algae flakes. As he goes to offer it to Vengeance, [Dex] high on the efflorescence of fish-notes from the water, and the sense-memory it's given him of his childhood when his nimbleness was at its peak, he almost unconsciously sidesteps as Palchin spills water where Vengeance's short sword was a moment ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: Ah, you'll excuse me, it's been a while since i've had to retrieve a palette cleanser for a patron.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: well we'll see if you get any tip from us.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I haven't even collected the drink tab, so I wasn't hopeful.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: what is the tab</li>\n<li>Palchin: one silver?</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc (tossing a gold): with tip</li>\n<li>Palchin: we only take honest coin here; tip is for an economy which doesn't pay its workers equitable. With a gold you're welcome to drink as long as you'd like. We also have rooms above.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>1:30 pm, ish.</p>\n<p>Drav, examining the stone sculpture [24], sees that it is of a squat dwarf, maybe half Drav's height. 2 or 2.5 feet tall. A female dwarf, whose eyes are set in an intense glare focused on a point 10 feet in front of itself, and its mouth is wide open as if screaming or about to scream. The quality of the stonework indicates that it is not a typical hill or mountain dwarf. This may be one of the Underdark dwarves, either who carved it, or who it's meant to resemble. it doesn't bring to mind a deity, but it looks purposive, as though not meant for worship. there are candles around it which are lit and have melted. There are flints and other rock flakes in piles or cairs nearby.</p>\n<p>The light beer, meant to be consumed all day in lieu of untrustworthy water, gets them reasonably happy. Flick and Vengeance can hear Palchin speaking in the back, with the occasional hissing or splashing noises audibly interpolated. Flick, looking for a believable pretext to approach the bar, surveys two pictures hung on the far wall. They are arranged such that the subjects appear to comprise part of the same body. The bottommost picture is a sea-serpent, long and thin with a head and tail; on top is a picture of a mountain lake remarkable like the one outside; the image is from the side; steam rises from the lake and the image of a woman's silhouette emerges from the lake's surface.</p>\n<p>Flick stands and makes a show of taking in the lake picture. As she approaches, [INT 4, WIS 8]. Flick finds herself completely paralyzed, retreating into her own mind, and is unable to experience what's going on around her. To those behind her she appears completely rigid. Drav notices this, but Vengeance is looking for locations to spit while Jean-Luc seeks to frustrate his efforts. Drav walks over to Flick and can determine her sight-line on the picture. Drav adjusts Flick's head; she still appears to be paralyzed. A glimmer of horror and ultimate confusion is apparent on her face, as though she's been confronted with something incomprehensible. Drav wonders aloud if they should skedaddle. Vengeance finishes his drink, precipitating a comfortable inebriation, walks over to the bar, and puts his shortsword onto the counter, you know, subtle-like. Oh, and he swept all the drinks off the table and shouted \"Enough!\" when standing up. [Intimidation] Quick motions are heard in the back, and Palchin peaks her head out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What's going on here? Why is your weapon laid across the bar?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: do you mind if i leave it there. it's a bit uncomfortable to carry.</li>\n<li>Palchin: no, not at all, let me clean around your sword for you. (He soaks a rag and goes to squeeze it out near the sword. )</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance grabs his hand to try to get him to squeeze the rag out into his mouth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: this is a classic dare from my younger days. we tended to put it in a shot glass first. Which of your friends are up for the challenge? it can't just be you. i'll take you on but i thought you wanted to introduce your friends to the game.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: It's not a challenge, I would hate to see you waste all of that fish water.</li>\n<li>Palchin: oh, this isn't the brew &hellip;.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: IS IT NOT?!</li>\n<li>Palchin: hey, are we going to have a problem here?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance [Perception n20] can tell it's the \"fish water\" as they have begun to call the beer (although Palchin had gone to say it wasn't) and also have a crown (supertooth), Vengeance can feel it begin to dissolve in his mouth. \"My supertooth! Not again!\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: what happened the first time?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I came up behind my mule too suddenly, and she knocked it out of my head. Just the crown part, she's quite accurate with her kicks.</li>\n<li>Palchin: that was her intent?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Yeah, she wouldn't want me to lose an actual tooth.</li>\n<li>Palchin: that depends how well you treat her. do you feed her &hellip; every day.?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Let's not get into it. the point is, YOU don't seem to care about my supertooth, nor about your bar, if you're pouring beer onto it to clean it. Let's have it, my man.</li>\n<li>Palchin: your sword --- should be cleaned as well by the waters, as the bar would be. -- this is what i use for cleaning: a mouth, sword, or bar.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: burping twice, the classic sound of a liar!</li>\n<li>Palchin: it can clean a mind</li>\n<li>Vengeance: Everyone, this man is hiding something!</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Meanwhile, Drav's furious signalling has alerted Jean-Luc to Flick's predicament. Drav goes to slap Flick, but, having to hop up, barely grazes Flick's jaw, and she doesn't react.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-Luc: look, we came in here looking for a drink. I've gotta be honest, I've killed people for less, please unparalyze my friend.</li>\n<li>Palchin: what's the matter with your friend? i've been in the back room this whole time.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: She appears to be paralyzed. I assume that's your doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Palchin looks at Flick, comes around the bar, \"It does look that way -- I believe this should remediate things.\" Drav is well aware that Palchin is about to pour more of this water on your shield, and on Flick's rapier. Drav pushes Palchin back out of the way, holding her shield and flick on the other side of her body.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: I was just trying to splash some water in your friend's face! that usually wakes people up.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: She's not asleep, she's paralyzed.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I have night-terrors --</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: One last time, what is going on here?!</li>\n<li>Palchin: I'm trying to serve some people in the off season. I guess I do get a little lonely. I'm sorry if I appear too aggressive. You gave me a full gold, I'm just trying to be as officious as possible.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: WHY IS MY FRIEND PARALYZED</li>\n<li>Palchin: Your guess is as good as mine. I think a good hearty slap would do it. The dwarf barely grazed her cheek. It looks like a bit of confusion. Strange, unaccountable things do happen on this mountain that can't be accounted for.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Drav is too focused on keeping Flick safe, ready for another splash attempt. Vengeance, with his specific connection with the weirdos of the world, is sure that Palchin is lying. Palchin knows why Flick is paralyzed, and what her condition is. Palchin may, Vengeance infers, have been a monk, and the means by which he subdues his natural reactions is monklike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: Jean-Luc, why don't you let me handle this. I think this matter requires a bit of delicacy. Palchin, if you don't tell us what you're up to, we're going to burn your house down and kill everybody that you love. I take that back &hellip; Palchin, what monastery did you happen to study in. You seem like you might follow the ways of the Tranquil monks.</li>\n<li>Palchin: How did you know?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I guess you could say that I'm a \"weirdo\" like yourself.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I wasn't going to say that, but &hellip; that's up to you. But yes -- I'm a monk of the Ivory Empire. But that was decades, if not almost a hundred years ago.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: I seem to recall we used to play that Monastery in stickball.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Stickball, yes! It's been quite a while. It certainly does bring back the memories. Some of our fellow monks were lucky enough to have their limbs amputated and replaced with sticks so as to play the game in its purest form.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: The game has changed a lot since then. These days everyone seems to be \"stick-doping\". It's sort of lost its lustre.</li>\n<li>Palchin: Stick-doping?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: No, like replacing their limbs with sticks. It's kind of unfair, don't you think.</li>\n<li>Palchin: well i think it's unfair in a religious sense, but maybe not in a physiomechanical sense. but of course, the religious sense is the most important. we're agreed there.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: given that the purpose of stick-ball is to be as much like a stick as you can</li>\n<li>Palchin: That's interesting, our monastery always had a different take on it, which was it's important to be as much like a ball impaled by a stick as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Flick begins to come out of her madness, Drav betwixt her and Palchin. Flick still hears the alien words being spoken resonating in her ears, but she's been turned to look into Drav's beautiful grey eyes; grey like the mountain ranges seen from the plains, and you have a gross puffy man, dripping sweat and water, standing next to you. She shouts and leaps backwards, adopting a defensive stance and reaching for her bow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: See, your friend is better than ever.</li>\n<li>Jean-Luc: doesn't explain how.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc [Insight n.1] feels like Palchin is making honest efforts, and, since Vengeance is going off, you might be beginning to side in part with Palchin. He advisedly delays reaching for his sword. Flick, meanwhile, is looking around for cues; seeing Jean-Luc just as puzzled, she does not know what to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeance: Hey, barkeep, is there a bathroom back there i could use? after all that fish oil</li>\n<li>Palchin: you were drinking oil?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: no, it's great, it's not a criticism, that your drinks seem to be high in omega 3s</li>\n<li>Palchin: sure, like aromatic oils. well most of the miners take a leak outside. this isn't a spot that has an internal bathroom. there is a bathroom over that way (west)</li>\n<li>Vengeance: do you have maybe a sink back that there? I need privacy. I won't be able to go, standing outside. i'm just gonna head back there if that's ok.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Palchin does appear to reluctantly allow Vengeance to go back.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palchin: I suppose if you do need privacy&hellip; The outhouse is an enclosed structure, but it does have that little crescent-shaped window. if you wanna head to the back, immediately go right, there's a trough sink for cleaning up paint brushes. you're sure this isn't a number 2?</li>\n<li>Vengeance: no, just the usual water colors. If you're a fellow artist, you'll know what i mean.</li>\n<li>palchin: i do primarily utilitarian painting. I like to keep that sign out front fresh.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: oh yeah, no, that's primo work.</li>\n<li>palchin: i was just out there the other day working on that. keep the chains bright as the sun, and the sign level as a carpenter's level.</li>\n<li>vengeance&asymp;: i would say that's what drew us to this place</li>\n<li>Palchin: no, i got one: level as the palaces of Modron. don't be back there too long; a lot of people get scared, -- there are a few mannequins back there under sheets; you might think they're ghosts, but they're not, they're mannequins.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: It'll be just like going at home.</li>\n<li>Palchin: I tailor my own clothes, is why. so i have bespoke mannequins for bespoke clothes. if you're a tailor you can't sew it on yourself.</li>\n<li>Vengeance: yeah, no, I can't imagine a more comfortable environment in which to urinate. thank you.

They certainly like fish, but won't put their lives in danger by rushing over to eat some.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Galen is thinking of a Fish poison thing supposed to replace fireball. Or he thought it would make someone so obsessed with Fish they would leave battle for it. Or something Fish Merchants can learn to get people to buy fish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance had times where he would go to market with Schlonzel and his father and step-mother, where he and Schlonzel learned the spell. Components are fish's tongue and essential algae sludge oil.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav casts Storm Sphere, damaging Gresh and one of the ghouls, and then calls lightning on Haberth.</p>\n<p>Gresh reaches for a chunky necklace.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap and JL recognize that the necklace is made out of larynxes and throats that are strung together. As Gresh reaches for it, it throbs and palpates like living tissue, and he resists the effects of the strong winds.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL Arcana check for necklace that is passive, or a magic that he's tapping into. (Will it protect anyone, or a skilled user only?) JL can't tell. (The winnnnnnnnds obscure his ability to tell.)</p>\n<p>There are higher-level versions of Fish Madness to get a far monarch to come to your stall, but Vengeance hasn't learned it yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance: I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to heal flick, but it seems like we can heal this battle with a good Fish Madness, and then we don't have to use our magic for healing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fish Madness is concentration, and can only affect one creature at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They haven't spent any time constructing antidotes. Oh, but JL has proficiency in Poisoner's Kit.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although DM hasn't exactly required adherence to Crafting and Harvesting Poisons rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance: Alright, fine, I'll do the healing thing. I mean, I feel like we're going to end up back here in another minute.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would really smelly fish help? It's the suggestion that has the range, not the fish odor.</p>\n<p>Could Vengeance cast it on Flick, and that would break the paralysis. Flick could choose to fail. But she doesn't trust Vengeance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is there anything Vengeance can use to expand the range of his spells? He doesn't have access to Metamagic that we've established.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fishmancer/ Ichthymancer class discussed. Mick suggests Aquaperson. Veangeance to go from Fist-based to Fish-based.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>V begins Qi-xotic confusion: Haberth, my friend, this reminds me of a story. Once upon a time, there were two neighboring kingdoms. The elvish kingdom of Throndenshlell, and the human kingdom of Arenbarsch. And the Queen of Arenbarsch (Argenbarscha) was quite powerful -- the confusion of the spell already begins to take effect -- . Gresh, you must listen as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance SSDC actually 12, so I don't think they both would have failed, but no matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He gets up on a pedestal. Listen, y'all, to my tale. He broadcasts the story: In order to form a politiacl alliance, the King of the Human kingdom Ascherdangje (Arenbarsh) (Argenbaishier) and the kingdoms lived in peace and harmony until there was an uprising and the humans decided they no longer wanted to be ruled by the elves and so they organized a revolution.</p>\n<p>Haberth: Are you sure this isn't a sleep spell?</p>\n<p>Vengeance: It's going to be more confusing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance: The workers stormed the elvish castle, and beheaded the Elvish king. Haberth: ? Vengeance: They didn't like that the human king married the elf, and the kingdom had economic troubles separate from this. So the \"workers\" made the wrong connection between causes. ... Anyway they beheaded the Human king, and it was terrible, and also his entire family. There was one butcher who ran into the Queen's bedroom, and was prepared to kill her, but he, when he saw her, couldn't do it, and sunk to his knees and wept. Haberth: Great, lardy tears. Vengeance: His name was Ham, the Butcher. Haberth: Talk about nominative determinism. Vengeance: You're not as confused as I wanted you to be. Haberth: Well, I am confused, only emotionally. I myself was Ham the butcher, in a way. In my youth I came across the most beautiful Gormflaith Queen who I'd been tasked with assassinating, and I was unable to do it, and that's why I now have to make my living as a pirate on the Seas of Kohsht. Vengeance: Well I knew this tale would have a particularly resonance for you, Haberth.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh. Kay. Jaap's turn.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap runs right up next to Flick and Dimension Doors them off the front lines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick (mumbling) I'm usually ... really good at this.</p>\n<p>Flick eyes the tops of the food trucks and thinks she's be able to stand on most of them with her delicate elven tournure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap tries a medicine check to give Flick ADV on her next paralysis save.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL is now alone with the ghouls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick fails her save. The smell of gnoll blood mixed with demon sap and fish increases her nauseau but it's too much for her sensitive habitude.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kalash. JL has to roll on poison as Kalash runs by him and passes. He's immune to the stench for 24 hours. \"I've been in worse smelling places than this. You've never been to a bar on All-you-can-eat-chili-night Island.\" Flick: did someone buy an island and call it that? Haberth: There are some among our kind who have that kind of money to burn. Flick: then they could build an aviary and call it all you can eat chili night island international aviary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL sees that ghouls wearing silver/turqoise brooches that are filigreed with intricate patterns. Gresh is not wearing one.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>History. JL can't tell what symbols might be. However, Brooches like this, as they get more ornate, are meaningful to heroic-chief-based societies, with all the jewelry and tattooes they represent their lives on their bodies. This might fit into this somehow, but since the patterns don't match, it might have a use.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh is actually confused and can't do anything. However, he and Vengeance have visions of:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gresh is poisoned. JL parries one attack.</p>\n<p>Flick: \"How does he have 3 attacks?\" &gt; Insight. She thnks he's a very high level fighter; it sems like Gresh has struck out on his own; he has some powerful gear . Flick thinks he's picked up an otherworldy patron. It might be related to the spear/javelin he's wielding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Gresh realizes that the weapon is doing to hit JL, JL can see a large red gem set in his armor on the left just inside the shoulder joint, and the lance glows with the same reddish-black energy, and JL takes 12 points of necrotic damage.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Haberth is confused. and does nothing. Vengeance sees Haberth looks around and tries to connect with Ham. \"SO what ... happened with Ham. Can you tell me any more about it?\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance: It is odd, isn't it? A butcher named Ham. Haberth: I guess I meant with him and the queen, cause I know it ended tragically with me. V :You kind of have to put the pieces together . It's like Mullahollanda drive (a long, confusing elven road). Haberth: Did you go to the same rhetorical college as teh Queen? Queen Falamash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL is used to fighting three on one, but in the other direction, so he disengages as a bonus action, moves and dashes to Pjorg and Vengeance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg sees JL shake off a weird vision ad run back handsomely. \"It's not a retreat, it's a tactical advance to the rear\" he says, skipping manly-ly.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mick takes a break because of a real world issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We take a break too. Back from break. Pjorg gets bumped down in the hturn order.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg begins meditating on some runes and waves Drav ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ogribious skirts the central node of the storm. Haberth, however, never moved out of the effect, and takes 8 bludgeoning damage. Haberth adn Gresh both remain confused, however.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav tries to lightning-stab one of the ghouls, but she's so amped for her upcoming fireball that she misses on the lightning. Her excitement also leads her to be less cautious, and she sets the northern side of the food truck on fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the commoner's who's poisoned gets a bit singed, and the food truck truck operator turns off their fry station and move the lard over to the burning portion of the truck. they get some kind of asbestos powder from a pouch, line a perimeter on the food truck, and the asbestos melts together and acts as a firebreak.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: Seems like they're been through this before. Jaap: One well-prepared Food truck person: I can't get any insurance on the truck unless I know this cantrip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: I've got three more of those, you nerds!</p>\n<p>JL makes a note not to get on DRav's bad side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Haberth takes all this damage, their poison radius expands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gresh still poisoned. Pjorg readies a reaction to Attack any creature that gets within range of him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"We're basically as tall as you if we get up on our ships.\" A ghoul steps up on the collapsed heap of the food truck. \"Look, see, even now.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EVeryone except Vengeance, fittingly, sees that the commoners affeted by poisoning begin to lose consciousness and fall to the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance takes out his mortar and pestle and crushes all the herbs, redirects some wind from the Storm spell, which flows through the flames coming off the food truck, incorporating fish fumes, into the sky, and everyone sees projected on the sky a red lobster commercial type thing, with fish on the grill, and cheddar bay biscuits.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ian : vengeance gets a lot of shit for being a mechanically useless chaos agent, but he's the reason JL and Flick are alive. DK: there's a reason we haven't killed him in his sleep. Galen: Vengeance isn't aware that he's trying to help with combat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>V realizes that only Gresh might be susceptible to being charmed.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gresh (nat 20 to resist) because he's not a ghoul-fisherman-pirate, seems oddly unaffected by the glowing advertisement.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, thanks for trying to bring in more customers for me! you can take half off for any frish fried in this froodtruck!\" (says the proprietor). \"like i said, insurance will cover all of that. living next to the ports, you get a lot of groups offering you insurance; you're a rounding error compared to these ship voyages.\"</p>\n<p>Jaap heals Flick. and tries to help her throw off the paralysis. Jaap accidentally hits Flick's funnybone.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Michael looks up Turn Undead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap and Flick are on top of the canvas roof of one of hte food trucks.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception check. Towards the waterfountain, he sees a barrel or pail with a brass placard. contoured to the barrel. It's made from Sandford brass. The Annoying Pail of Justice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>History check. 15. He doesn't know about this specifically, but can guess that it's a piece of local lore. It's possible that it may have magical energy, but it seems pretty mundane from where he's sitting.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick's turn. Fails again to get out of paralysis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kalash. spots Vengeance, and appears distracted by the spinning lobster; nevertheless this blackish-red blood oozes from the welts raised by the fireballs and flick's force arrows. Her tattoos are livid against her pale skin. She rushes forwards to attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance is immune to the poison. He takes 23 damage from the bite . The ghoul's mouth opens abnormally wide and chomps onto his flower hat, but it ends up as just garnish on the mouthful. He gets hit with a claw attack that doesn't paralyze him. He's not surprised. It's fitting that a weird fish creature could claw him and not be affected by amoebas, and that he had wished would kill Schlonzel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance does believe that the Oath of Rust is involved, so he can invoke Hatred of Schlonzel to re-roll a d20.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception. (i probably didn't need to make him do this)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looking at the Brooch, and he notices that the blue stone is turqoise, and the silver is made of the irridium -- the meetal being traded to the ghouls because it's resistant to rust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gresh moves normally; not affected by the confusion. \"how dare you try to make me think fish are delicious!\" and attacks. still poisoned, he's attacking at disadvantage, but he hits with the spear and infuses his attack with dark energy, taking 24 damage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance, losing consciousness, says: \"you know, that would be really great for spearing some fish.\" Gresh looks like he's charging up to do something else, but he's (already used his bonus action).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Haberth attacks someone in his reach. it looks like he's blind from blood dripping; his eyelids got fried off from the fireball, and he wildly slashes with his claws.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: runs over to flank and KH attack Gresh. Fresh Gresh Fish. Vengeance: \"say something cool about fish, jeanluc!\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL gets a crit with one dagger, and then ... does 43 damage with his sneak attack. He stabs him in the neck, as close to the spine he can get, and dashes back to the giant Pjorg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gresh is now bloodied from this precise stab.</p>\n<p>JL: \"FISH!\" All three of the ghouls perk up at that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg. \"Imagine, if you would, a great axe\" Kalash: Habert, it looks like he&nbsp;is&nbsp;smaller than you. Habert: No, I think ... all the smoke coming off this food truck ... Pjorg: i tak eback my encouragement, you're a small piece of shit. Kalash: did someone say piece of fish? Vendor: A rare hundred percent fish price, get it while you can!</p>\n<p>Pjorg does critical damage. and invokes the Fire Rune. Kalash. They fail the strength check. so they are restrained for one minute. 2d6 fire at beginning of turns, can save at end of each of turns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kalash, writhing around in flaming shackles, smells like burning sewage. Pjorg has smelled far worse than this, certainly since people have begun throwing refuse out of the windows at him when he's in goblin form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg action surges to do the attack action. and murders Kalash. he raises the great axe, which comes down, then up through the fiery shackled, and splits the head straight up? and Pjorg brings his axe back down to the ground: \"they all fall so small-ly\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Haberth and Ogribious shout out her name. But Haberth can't quite tell her direction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg, \"for funzies\" looks over at Haberth, \"you're so small that this is probably going to go over your head.\" H: the joke? P: yes.</p>\n<p>27 to hit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Pjorg is a whirlwind of death\". he throws the handaxe, which slams into H's body for 11 damage. \"I don' think that went over my head.\" Pjorg: you'll get it. H: no, i've gotten it. i assure you.\"</p>\n<p>For his bonus action he Disengages. His plan is to keep Vengeance alive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance meanwhile is crawling slowly towars the food truck with his hand out . \"All I want is one taste of fish before I die.\"</p>\n<p>Ogribious takes a moment to look around.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DK: does he hate fish? can i taunt him? DM: the ghouls&nbsp;like&nbsp;fish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL taunts Ogribious. \"Hey ugly, over here. O: Gresh, he's talking to you. JL: I'm talking to either of you. Flick (mouth paralyzed): pretty sick burn, Ogribious. O: Thanks bro.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ogribious sees that K is down; they run over to Haberth: come on, let's get the fuck out of here! They pull Haberth up towards the top of the plaza to get some cover. they make it up to ... there. \"Sorry Gresh, no hard feelings.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav casts another fireball in order to miss the commoners. Ogribious and Haberth fail and pass, respectively. it lights the remaining clothing of theirs on fire, revealing more tattoos. any rust on their earrings has been burnt off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The tattoos are not triangles. Pjorg doesn't see any thieves-guild triangles, not that he would know. A lot of their tattoos look like the Book oof Kells; historiated ropes and knots and fantastical creatures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav ends her turn to lightning-bolt Gresh. Flick believes herself to be a bad influence on Drav.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[is this done?]</p>"}

While Paros futzes about with a draconic alarm clock, the wood elf deferrs her doze upon detecting some curious odors emanating from the hob. Polive walks Joan to a worktable in the back where she fits the adventuresome dragonborn with the promised prototype of \"septum gear,\" a twin of the one seen in situ on Nexnag resembling a boiler's pressure release valve and provides brief instruction in its use and maintenance. Meanwhile our resident planar warrior, much like an astronomien^ secluded deep within a transcolating <em>beorh&thorn;^</em> to detect nought but the unmistakable issels^ of an eludent cosmocaust, is a bit \"weirded out;\" the familiar traces of Thuridan's feybubble and Baba Jezda's fading portalian aura are soon outshadowed by a curious notch in the worldgrain some few hundred yards to her left. Notorious maverick Drav inquisitively sticks her head into the oven while Domonkos, having succumbed to Paros's exhortation to accompany them, skeptically bites into a @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{bloodcake} (one of Polive's confectionaries), whose ingrediential^ provenance poses him cause for concern.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-14c7cd10-7fff-6aa1-8078-3b9799bfec02\"></span></p>\n<hr />\n<div><strong>shilvery</strong>:&nbsp;(perh.) <em>Moir&eacute; metallique</em>.</div>\n<div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce0333f7-7fff-9b13-242c-bb13474d2e90\"><strong>astronomien</strong>: Astronaut.</span></div>\n<div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-897653e9-7fff-f67a-b56e-19de1ac02b5b\"><strong>beorh&thorn;</strong>: </span>(perh.)

A second, similar creature shows up, and the two tag-team in an attempt to first wrest Drav's spellbooks from her and then, when that proves too delicate an operation, try to swallow her whole. Bolsterd by the team, the wizard buffets off attacks with her Eldarian shield until she spies an opportunity to chase after one of the creatures, wallop it with her quarterstaff, and thunderstep onto the highest building, out of the reach of the teleporting anurines. At this point, seeing the tide turn against them, the two assailants, despite their white clothes, easily disappear into the shadows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By now it has become clear that Jean-Luc is no longer present and, after a momentarily suspecting him of turning on the group, they recognize that the attack was in part cover to abduct their roguish golden boy. The only clues to the events of his capture include a half-eaten hogdog and signs of a scuffle in the sand and dust of the street.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jean-Luc wakes up in an empty stall of a stable, tied to a chair and bereft of his weapons and armor. Tishara Vernix steps around the stall door and informs him that this most recent attempt at deception has tried her patience, and if the Log of Pathyus is not delivered to her by the next evening, she will begin relieving Jean-Luc of his appendages and mailing them to his friends.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc_2\">Transcript</h1>\n<h2 id=\"toc_3\">Pre-roll</h2>\n<p>Faction Quadro-Lats whose symbol is a hexagon and numeric system is base-16. There are also the Base-6s, and there are 6 hits in a height. It's a bunch of mathematicians who could never get jobs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick is holding onto Gresh's evil throat necklace, \"out of flight out of sight\" and is lousy with gem foam. A classic half-orc \"thing\" is that one's ability to Insight people are heightened in dangerous circumstances. Orc uses a base-15 counting system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick wants to recover Nubbs the baby salamander, and if the Hat Baskets want to follow us to Cressida, that's up to them. Pjorg wants to go to an Alchemical Brothers concert and open for them as Mix-turition.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">Catching a tail</h2>\n<p>As they leave the interrogation warehouse, they are intent on finding a book with which to fool the Hat Baskets. (Apparently it has word-search capabilities, and shows the answers to your questions as well.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: when I was in the Fountain of Elegance I made it known I wanted a meeting, so they are going to intercept us in the next few hours. Let's find somewhere to nurse our wounds. They are going to find us no matter where we are, that's the one thing they seem pretty good at; I want to cast about for a respectable inn within walking distance. They head towards the center of the town, the Triggered Beta (which needs to be in everyone's face while self-segregating) specifically, whose fish Flick wishes to try.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>KH Perception check. Flick nat 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg examines the inside of his helmet. What's in there?</p>\n<p>Flick and Jaap see, trailing behind them, the woman from the Fountain of Elegance (tall, with polished greenish-blue skin, completely bald, piercing golden-brown eyes, wearing a well-tailored white dress, simple sandals. she comes forward.). Her features now, though, look slightly distorted, almost like they've become flattened and expanded, and her eyes bulge slightly and have moved partly to the side of her head, making the lenticular pupils all that much weirder.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WIS saving throw.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick believes she's cloaked herself in a sort of funhouse illusion, the ones they were handing out as spellscrolls to kids at the plaza to let them look like a weird animal. Jaap can't even tell if it's even a spell. Flick finds it amusing that she's stupid enough to try to follow them. However, Flick, nose-deep in the various sagas she's reading, exhibits expressions that read really largely, and the woman blinks out of sight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our elf ranger makes for an alley in order to hide and observe surreptitiously what is happening. Taking this moment, Flick is unable to see Jean-Luc, assuming at first he sold them out, but then anxious for his wellbeing, remembering that she and Jaap had been less than circumspect talking about the Demerast Saga while walking towards the inn.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg is still unawares, and Flick wildly waves the commoners back into their buildings out of harm's way, forgetting that she is essentially invisible to all but the most perceptive creatures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just then, a second, similarly teleporting person ( knave, brigand, blackguard ? dressed leather armor and \"in sordid ways\", with a rusty dagger at their side) teleports up next to Drav and spits out its dark red, stretchy, sticky tongue, attempting to snake it into her rucksack. Drav is used to seeing carnivorous plants and creatures with long tongues like this in Forest Ogrelodge, and pulls her bag away just in time, as she feels the salivary mist pop next to her face. It then disengages as a bonus action and sprints back into the shadows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick can still hear it as it rounds the corner (i.e. it is not hidden) around a row house.</p>\n<p>Flick, having just encouraged the townsfolk back into their homes, yells to Drav, Shatter! Bring down the building!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav, clutching her bag between her body and her elbow, meets her restricted hand with her free hand, sculpting a ball of sparkling frost in the air and sending it with a flick towards the knave, catches it lightly on the earlobe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap is quite excited by all of these appearances and disappearances, they remind him of an old gnome holiday. What a fun place! Jaap can't place a connection between these creatures and Drav and her books.</p>\n<p>Flick (to herself?) how would they have known that Drav has these books?</p>\n<p>Jaap can also now see Flick because of his perception check. He moves over to Drav and prepares a reaction to defend Drav (with his fists) if a creature pops up next to her again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The group closes in on Drav in order to protect her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg is concerned that one of the runes on his gear got slightly nicked when he threw an ax blade. If the runes are altered in any way it's impossible to predict how they are going to react, so it makes completely sense to have them on the outside of things, largely because their power is directed outwards.</p>\n<p>Flick ruminates that she knows as much about runes as about ... love. which is not very much. Then, tumbling out of the alley, she calls on her Planar Warrior force power to go after one of the hyper-pale, dreadlocked Matrix twins.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The DM realizes he's been quite inconsistent with regard to the appearance of these creatures.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The creature jukes to one side, and the arrow goes wide, but Flick pulls it back to her and it cartoon rocket brakes to smack into them from the back. Blammo! They take a full step back, and cannot answer Flick's question: Where do you think you're going!? The elf then ducks back and gets to cover.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the stitches on their leather armor come loose, and they are wearing the same white suit under their leather armor as Oriax. On the clothing they see the Erudite [bullseye] image embroidered in brown. The same insurance company that covers the vendors will only cover these guys if they cover their bullseye cult symbol under armor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oriax comes sprinting out of another alley towards Drav, and her entire mouth enlarges to the point where it's the size of her torso, almost like a frog opening its mouth wide -- as though her entire torso was her gullet -- and attempts to engulf the dwarf. Jaap now uses his reaction to try to shove her, but he'd planted himself a little too far away to properly interpose himself.</p>\n<p>Jaap tried, he thinks.</p>\n<p>Drav conjures up a shield which fills the creature's maw like a stick holding a T-rex mouth open. Oriax, daunted, teleports to the other side of the street, but fails to hide, and there she stands, her inelastic mouth slowly closing. Rivulets of saliva drip down the shield.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg shuffles up, in goblin form, and connects with his awkward battleaxe once.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Triangulation is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the most difficult calculation to manipulate, we learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The other twin, mouth agape, teleports directly next to Drav, her shield still up, lets out a loud intimidating croak after being deflected by the croak, and successfully hides after being cracked in the back by Drav's quarterstaff. A sore opens, and black droplets that become shadow wisps, dissipate up into the air.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Luck check to determine how many tall buildings there are -- almost every other one.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav runs to the last place she saw the creature, and thundersteps to the tallest building in range, wrecking Flanagarn with the concussive force, which also creates a thunderous boom audible to those within 300 feet.</p>\n<p>Jaap casts sacred flame,&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Hit\" points are a rewards program with the 6-hits-in-a-height gang. When you visit one of their money laundering locations you get \"hit\" points.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap moves up the road and does another look around. Flick gives an encouraging whistle to Drav, shouts \"gotta put these arrows somewhere\" and gets herself into position to hit the Erudite. The arrow, with pale-blue flourescence, \"glitches out\" as it passes through Pjorg and strikes the woman in the chest with a force arrow, and then with a regular arrow. Droplets of black liquid pool in the air and fall upwards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You all are turning out to be more than I'd bargained for, she says, disengaging and running away, effectively disappearing in the shadow of the alley.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Awwwwwwww.</p>\n<p>Flick: It's ok, if they come back, you've got dibs.</p>\n<p>Jaap returns to the place where Jean-Luc was last seen, and sees a dagger pinning a piece of paper to a wooden door.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav begins to lower herself down, until the rope-of-climbing that Flick sends up taps the dwarf on the shoulder.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The dagger has the same white, blue, and green beading as the last one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"We know you tried to fake the ledger. We'll consider exchanging Jean-Luc for the actual one. Have it tomorrow by sundown at The Majesty's Pelt or we begin to send him back in pieces.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They see recent scuffle marks on the street, but no froglike saliva. There is, however, half a hotdog on the ground, so they surmise that Jean-luc stopped to buy a hogdog and that's when he was taken.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Jean-Luc will always be remembered for his love of hogdogs.</p>\n<p>Flick: We can try to track the down and do a jail-break scenario, or we can go to the snake people, ask to borrow the real ledge, and use it as a diversion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Small one, you forget the third option. Double down on the fake ledger plan. They would never expect it: direct subterfuge.</p>\n<p>Flick: That's just crazy enough to work.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: That reminds me of a time carving a rune.</p>\n<p>Flick waits impatiently for Pjorg to continue the story, but he does not.</p>\n<p>Flick recreates the symbol she saw embroidered on the clothing of the second assassin. Pjorg, does this glyph look familiar to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg remembers this insignia clearly: he saw it scorched on the ground when he awoke after his transformation into a goblin; it was apparent in the way that bodies had been arranged. It is not the Order of Rust, thank Grod.</p>\n<p>Jaap (The gnomes are interested in accidental discoveries, and learned about The Erudite, allows him to connect with Oriax working at the bookstore; they believe that those who are unlearned, or illiterate, are superior to the learned, and that they have more of life's essential knowledge than the learned. There are sects, and some are bookburners in order to create a world where everyone is unlearned (unread) and some just promote it through missionary work. or treat it like a lifestyle. (Flick, in the Demerast saga, had thought this was just part of the book.</p>\n<p>The bookstore makes sense because there's a sect that allows&nbsp;some&nbsp;learned/written knowledge, but a very restricted and curated subset, and encourage a practical/oral understanding of life as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: The lady i talked to at the Fountain of Elegance seemed almost aggressively uninterested in books. (She thinks now that, not having looked in any of the books, maybe they were just empty placeholders, blank books with dustcovers -- and now she's kicking herself because that probably tipped them off, and suspects that if Jean-Luc were here he might be able to tell you the actual connection between them and the hat baskets.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But perhaps if they send them JL's tongue they can use magic to get it to talk...</p>\n<p>Drav thinks that the Erudite wanted to destroy the spellbooks they knew Drav was carrying. She's one of the morem powerful arcane magic users to come into town in a while. Her books glow like a beacon to creatures like this. Maybe they made a (temporary) alliance with HB when they realized they had a dog in the fight -- they were a two-pronged attack. The party is pretty sure that the two groups were working together. But the hog dog ... ? There's no hog dog stand in evidence.</p>\n<p>Flick gets distracted by graffito of a guy at a hog dog stand covered in dick-rotting-fish? JL wouldn't have been able to get a hogdog from this.</p>\n<p>Flick examines the hogdog. She smells hogdog coming from one of the houses nearby. \"Jean-Luc would have known where the good hogdog houses are. He's a man of refinement.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everyone is crouched in the dirt around the hogdog, and the camera pulls back on a crane. A saxophone dirge begins, and as the camera gets higher in the sky the viewer sees that the entire city of Sandford is shaped like a giant hogdog.</p>\n<h2>Jean-Luc</h2>\n<p>Jean-Luc, slightly trailing his companions as they marched towards the Triggered Beta inn, found himself enticed by a spicy nostalgic scent -- Kriobolitan sausages! It had been weeks since he had any real taste of home, and though enjoying the adventure and happy to be running from the troubles of Kreabolois, the southern contents of Marshbout really ought to take some cooking lessons. He approached the food cart from which the odor seemed to be wafting, and, after bragging about his mother's culinary expertise to the vendor and expressing his eagerness for the day his mother's secret recipe for the meaty delicacies would be passed down to him, he gladly purchased one and took a hearty bite. The sausage was spiced well, if a bit undercooked, but as the remnants of his bite traveled down his throat a faint metallic aftertaste lingered on his tongue. Within moments, a powerful narcotic washed over his body. He became faintly aware of three figures wearing decidedly quaint masks advancing on him and though he turned to confront them they moved too quickly. His balance failed him and he was quickly restrained. Jean-Luc attempted to alert his adventuring companions; even though he could feel the effort of his shouts, however, no sounds issued from his mouth. Just before his vision went black, he saw the food cart proprietor grip the trolley and toddle frantically back into a dim alleyway.</p>\n<p>He awoke feeling as though years had passed, having been beset in the interim by claustrophobic dreams in which he prowled around a strangely familiar city (Kreepolopas? Krabopolis?). He wandered through dim, labyrinthine streets populated by figures from his childhood -- a baker who'd always had a sweet bun ready for him; a friendly councilwoman of the ward who vouched his mother for a loan; one of his charter-school chums from whom he'd first begun to learn lock-picking; a witty, troublesome redheaded daughter of a shopkeeper -- none of whose names he could recall. That girl, though, she had been something special to him. What was her name? Laura? Lara? Laria? Alara? Alaria? Elaria? Pelaria? The name stuck fast in his mind: he couldn't think of any other name, any other word, any other world. Just Pelaria. Pelaria. Pelaria.</p>\n<p>\"Good. You're up.\" Jean-Luc looked around, but the smell hit him first. Horse. He was in a stable. In a stall. There was still some horse shit on the fresh straw covering the floor, so he knew that his \"accommodations\" had been made up somewhat hastily. Or someone had a very particular idea about discomfort. As his eyes adjusted to the dim light, he suspected that both suppositions could be true: at a glance, the tack on the wall looked to be quite expensive: the saddle alone would fetch almost 100 gp from a generous fence. The rest of the accoutrements screamed show horse rather than a working beast. The fog from the narcotic lingered, without any of the pleasant afterglow he would have expected if it had been one of the ones he&rsquo;d take willingly. Absent any other options he focused again on the saddle; there was a monogram on it, and he didn't need some magic darkvision (some of his companions had that right? Where was that elf when he needed her?) to guess that it started with a \"T\" and ended with a \"V.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indeed, as his mind raced through all the possible meanings of those initials, he noticed a flash of light coming from a reflective surface at about eye level by the frame of the stall door. The object was immediately retracted, and Tishara Vernix, purported head of the Hat Baskets, casually slotting a jointed mirror into a loop on her middle belt, stepped into view. Her forest-green, almost satiny hair created an eerie moir&eacute; effect in the shadowy stable and hung in a thick braid over a well-starched, ruffed-neck white blouse and a dark brown riding jacket. The jacket, and her riding pants, were embroidered in the same, clashing green, blue, and white beadwork he'd seen on the guild's dagger. The pants looked rumpled, and he suspected that she'd just rode in, probably urgently. Whether that had to do with just him was anyone's guess.</p>\n<p>\"I let it be known to your ... consociates ... that the longer we go without the Ledger of Pathytus, the more they'll have to learn to do their own accounting. Of your body parts.\" Her delivery left something to be desired, and Jean-Luc noticed, before she could hide it, disappointment with herself, and perhaps a touch of a distracted mind.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ugh. Amateurs&rdquo; Jean Luc thought.&nbsp; He hated taking hostages. It was almost always a small child for maximum leverage. You needed to communicate with the family, arrange a drop off and in the interim you had a blubbering, and loud, quarry to contend with. In addition while the noble class deserved to be separated from their wealth, children ought to be off limits.&nbsp; Even if you were successful the family usually sent mercenaries after you in an understandable act of retribution. &ldquo;Far easier to just steal the payment directly&rdquo;, he thought wistfully as he settled in and waited to see if his new companions were as loyal as he hoped.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

When a leader determines a member has violated these norms they [alert] the Rictus, who, rumor has it, [takes these breaches very seriously, so much so that they] carve teeth out and cut the offender's hands and feet off leaving them unable to practice. Jean Luc is reasonably sure that his crimes against the Gaol Madiens fall within the bounds of acceptable tradecraft, but [one can't quite be sure of these things].</p>\n<div dir=\"auto\">As for the Rictus, there are many rumors whispered about why they do what they do. Jean Luc has heard they were once betrayed by a partner, some thieves have suggested that The Rictus just enjoys the challenge of hunting elusive prey, there are those who belive that the Rictus isn't human -- that they are an apparition or golem given form and purpose to punish betrayers.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h1>Gaol Maidens</h1>\n<h2>Skin treatments</h2>\n<p>... skin treatments even more dubious than ones he'd had to pass off on unsuspecting tourists (he'd started pretty low on the career ladder with the Maidens). {&sect;030}</p>\n<h2>The smell</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>JL: does the smell reach out here? (yes)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JL reluctantly walks into the temple; hoists himself in through window.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WIS save. fail.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The sight of all this&nbsp; brings you back to something that you'd blocked out of your mind that happened with a gang you were with; you feel like you remember opening a door and seeing something like this in the room opposite. couldn't tell if it was a butchery or site of torture. door slammed in your face, and one of the criminals screamed that you shouldn't be in that area. (disadv. on ability checks until takes damage / or 10 minutes) {&sect;027}</p>\n<h2>Falling out</h2>\n<p>Growing increasingly disillusioned by the direction that the Gaol Maidens are heading, Jean Luc is summoned to a meeting to discuss their latest caper.&nbsp; The target is the daughter of a particularly wealthy, but also stubborn, noble, with a reputation for killing intruders on his sprawling estate. The estate is guarded with soldiers and magical wards and so the decision is made to kidnap his daughter during a local parade.&nbsp; Aware that if successful the Gaol Maidens will almost certainly hurt an innocent child before her father might capitulate to paying the ransom, Jean Luc's conscience gets the better of him.&nbsp; Because the plan involves a lot of moving parts, all that's necessary to disrupt it is a small wrench in the gears.&nbsp; So as the Gaol Maidens are getting into position, Jean Luc sets fire to one of the parade wagons, causing mass panic. The noble and his soldiers quickly flee with the target, but the Gaol Maidens quickly figure out who started the fire and thus Jean Luc is forced to flee.</p>\n<p>[As far as his mindset, ] he knows he betrayed the Gaol Maidens he regrets leaving Majorie behind. But he also knows that that kidnapping could not have been allowed to take place and that he thwarted it without involving the authorities or alerting the family (thus inviting reprisal) affords him some measure of a peaceful conscience.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Yolindar</h2>\n<p>Jean Luc and Yolindar were never involved {s.044}.</p>\n<h2>Lydia</h2>\n<p>Lydia was Jean-Luc's first love. The fiesty but exceedingly kind daughter of a local shopkeep captured his young heart.&nbsp; Alas she didn't share Jean-Luc's revolutionary ideals and after a long heartwrenching discussion she and Jean Luc agreed it best to part ways. As Jean-Luc is prone to over-exaggeration, when he [reluctantly] tells the story of how his sword got her name, Lydia is painted as a bewitching temptress who remorselessly cuts outs men's hearts with ruthless precision. [But he knows this isn't true]</p>\n<h1>False Identities</h1>\n<h2>Patrick Druplet, Certified Real Estate Agent</h2>\n<p>Originally Jean Luc's real estate license was just a way to launder money.&nbsp; Buy a cheap plot of land or building, \"sell\" it to a client looking to purchase Gaol Maidens services at several times what was paid for it, then in a few months have a different Gaol Maiden buy the property back at low value, rinse and repeat.&nbsp; In a large enough city such transactions get lost in the shuffle.</p>\n<p>However soon Jean Luc found that taking on the persona of a real estate agent was a great cover. \"Why am I sneaking around these warehouses? I'm thinking of turning them into condos\".&nbsp; \"What's with all the boxes? I'm staging a place\" \"I'd love to learn more about this building, you say there's a balcony in the back, but what if people try to climb in?&nbsp; Oh it's warded, clever\"</p>\n<p>Thus \"Patrick Druplet\" was born; somewhat naive and hapless, Patrick is all too happy to look around empty buildings and back rooms in search of \"good bones\" for his next flip.</p>\n<h2>Pumpkin Prince</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;(The Pumpkin Prince is a persona that Jean-Luc had adopted to infiltrate royal courts; you heard it here first, folks). {&sect;040}</p>"}

My concern is with this spoiled ranger who keeps grabbing things as if from a void.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: as weird as they are, these people are my friends.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: So you&rsquo;re a little thief too?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Little? I&rsquo;d like to think I'm 'medium' to 'renowned'.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Are we talking about height or notoriety?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: Why not both?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: why does it always have to be about height?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc: semantically arguing with a demon-bear is not one of the things I imagined doing.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: your extra-little cleric friend over here could tell you that.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: she&rsquo;s talking about Carlos.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Yeah, the dwarf. Compared to you, Fez, he&rsquo;s a giant. With that robe, it&rsquo;s hard to tell gender, in case I used the wrong one right there.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: You&rsquo;ve been backpedalling like this since you got here.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: TBH this isn&rsquo;t my natural habitat. I&rsquo;m used to the woods.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: You still have to be better.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I do my best. What are you saying I don&rsquo;t do well enough? You all are the ones with privilege. Ganging up on me in a dungeon. This feels like a zoo enclosure.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: YOU came in HERE. &hellip; This is going to get GRIZZLY.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I&rsquo;m not a black, polar, or grizzly bear. Are you another cleric? You don&rsquo;t appear to have a deity you dedicate yourself to?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: That&rsquo;s a solid maybe. But this fight is going to be a LOSS for you. You came to talk about goodberries, but we&rsquo;re going to say goodbye. Also you&rsquo;re a metaphysical construct that doesn&rsquo;t exist outside this dungeon.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Aren&rsquo;t we all? When before have you disappeared into an ineluctable dungeon with the face of a god on the floor.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus takes a flying leap onto Shoemaker&rsquo;s back and attacks with his Karbunqle staff. He smashes his hand against the kettle-pot after smashing her over the head with his staff. Hieronymus skips out of there, but Shoemaker catches him in the heel with her greataxe.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: So many of you are in robes. It&rsquo;s hard to tell with the body ends and the robe starts. I don&rsquo;t wear clothes so it&rsquo;s difficult to figure out the geometry.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: I plan on wearing your pelt when we kill you.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Be careful my pelt doesn&rsquo;t wear &hellip; you &hellip; after you put it on.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Well I&rsquo;ve always wanted a good hair-shirt.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Definitely don&rsquo;t take my helmet! It&rsquo;s just here for decoration. And it even looks stupid!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick [Insight 18] Shoemaker doesn&rsquo;t want you to take the helmet.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc continues to debate what kind of 12-dimensional kettlepot bear chess Shoemaker is playing.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick intuits that this helmet has something to do with the fire suppression compulsion, and her ability to invoke the soil spirit.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez knows that the helmet needs to come off. For no reason.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: &ldquo;Since the dawn of time, bears have not worn helmets on their heads.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez remembers Ponderous bears, Lugubrious bears, (halflings consider themselves so entertaining that other entities that couldn&rsquo;t speak common were considered boring); Insipid bears (all from childhood books about bears)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- it is speaking to you, and with the accent of the lead singer of a band, so as a halfling you might even feel a little affiliation with them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav shoots a ray of frost that misses Shoemaker, but adorns the vat of earth with some frosty tips.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Will it take us to Flavortown? [investigation explosion of 2]: Flavortown will commence shortly.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- the raw smell of city earth when construction crews have dug up a sub basement.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick has &ldquo;put out the fire&rdquo;, nor is she obsessed with kindling. Flick remembers knocking over Drav and shouting at her&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick [perception 16] can tell there is something odd about the active radius around the vat of earth.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez is slightly spacey to start with, thinking about how clever he is most of the time; he might have sneezed at the melty-flesh vision.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick avoids using planar warrior; throws a hunters mark at Shoemaker. &ldquo;You made a mistake that&rsquo;s just the first in a long line of mistakes!&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I&rsquo;m here as a warning to you! (Flick shoots her twice; nocks a third arrow)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: &ldquo;You can fuck off, or we can keep doing this.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re so resistant to being helped, as far as your only true powers are concerned.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick narrows her eyes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker turns to Fez: And what did YOU just say? (presumably about flavor town). Frazzled by Flick&rsquo;s arrows, she&rsquo;s unable to swing her axe properly. However, she&rsquo;s close enough to the vase to shake it like a delicate maraca in Fez&rsquo;s direction. Closer to the epicenter, Fez feels his body start to come unglued, and then snaps back into stability.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc successfully puts together a Snav Snifter (red dragon burp, gremlo&rsquo;s indigestion? gremlo&rsquo;s heartburn? bigby&rsquo;s &ldquo;i ate too many spicy wings [spicy wings are angel wings torn off in hell and eaten by demons]&rdquo;), which he finishes and shouts: &ldquo;Fez, get out of the way!&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: when you say &ldquo;Watch out&rdquo; i can hear that too.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez attacks with whip, hits, runs and hops up on the bar.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: &ldquo;when i&rsquo;m not rolling around &hellip;&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: &ldquo;Oh yeah, why don&rsquo;t you feel a bit warm right now?&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: &ldquo;No, as a wood elf I know when things are on fire. and i&rsquo;m not on fire in the middle of a damp dungeon underground.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of coal-mine fires? In any case, you should still feel guilt about the way you abuse your magic.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: I&rsquo;m gonna take all your Goodberries after we explode your corpse.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: There&rsquo;s not a finite supply.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Then why are you mad about it?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: because you open yourself up to retaliation each time you grab one from elsewhere. You don&rsquo;t remain safe when you use your portal spells. &mdash; no snappy retort, eh?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus does what he thinks is whisper telepathically to his friends. &ldquo;Guys, I know this bear&rsquo;s weakness. If I take her kettle off, her brains will be exposed underneath.&rdquo; &mdash; He takes out his bagpipes and thinks back to the first song he learned in the monastery: the bare bear-plains national anthem. (which is the only song he can play). there&rsquo;s a heavily orchestrated version ; but hieronymus is playing the hot cross buns learner&rsquo;s version. he starts to play and looks over to see if Shoemaker is reacting in any way, like taking her helmet off (out of respect)&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- He plays really terribly but realizes that no one else can hear his telepathy; it might be that tapping into the whisper walls is using all his telepathic energy, or nobody heard him (not getting service down here). but he still thinks he&rsquo;s telepathic. He plays so badly that it angers Shoemaker.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: this is like the sounds of the elks mating in the winter. which i hate. everything else mating, though, i love.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude (shouting) : did i hear that it was damp up there? it is quite wet down here as well; we should consider uniting the spaces in an aquatic park of entertainment. and murder.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I would love send you to sea world.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: to see which world?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: the world in which you don&rsquo;t exist.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I feel like that is a logical contradiction. yes they never did teach you logic at the monastery, did they? that&rsquo;s reserved for those 200 years old or older.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: but i&rsquo;m like&hellip; at least 300.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I thought I was at least 300. But &hellip; then why didn&rsquo;t you ever take logic classes?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: oh that&rsquo;s right, because we&rsquo;re twins.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Yes, indeed, we are born of the same mother</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: yes, like all elves at the monastery. don&rsquo;t you remember when we all hatched at the same time?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: of course; elves hatch from eggs. you made sure you use my hypertrophied fingernails and toenails to chip open the egg for yourself. it&rsquo;s where my obsession with manicures comes from. i never want to be instrumentalized again. but you have no problem instrumentalizing others.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: i seem to be having a bit of a problem with my instrument. once it&rsquo;s fixed &hellip; things are going to go down.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: did i hear the bare bear-plain national anthem?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: i was, yes</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: i must tell you that the bears have overthrown their nationalist ambitions, and since have joined together as a consensus-based democracy of bears.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: well if you know so much, why don&rsquo;t you come up here and play it yourself?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: is that an invitation which aims to dispel the fact that i have been turned from the doughty cleric up there?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: yeah, it&rsquo;s like &hellip; a detente.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Ok well i will see you shortly.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: i definitely can wait, because i hate you.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: did someone say Snav? he&rsquo;s well-known around here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick thinks back to Joan, and wonders if she made it back to Marshbout or Cressida.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav (Angela has left; through Ian) casts &hellip; ? fire bolt.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker, a fire-retardant creature, only takes 1/2 damage. -- Perhaps on a ponderous bear that might have worked, but some of us spend our entire lives putting out fires in the woods.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Eldar goes to re-tag Drav to start the game up again, doing a bunch of damage. \"Drav, don&rsquo;t you remember? we were never supposed to tell your new parents about me. I was one of the reasons that you were forced out of your birth home. doesn&rsquo;t this ring a bell?\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick reaches out and envelops Shoemaker in an energy field, and tries to explode it in a point. for damage.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- retreats out to table, and then tries a called shot to try to knock the kettle off her head.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- The kettle falls off Shoemaker&rsquo;s head and clangs against the floor.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I gave you a lot to think about, eh?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez, standing on the bar, gets his legs cut out from under him as Shoemaker rushes up with her great axe.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I&rsquo;m too tired to go back and get my helmet. unrelated, my ass, with its callouses, is the toughest part of my body.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc repositions himself and throws a Snav&rsquo;s Snifter, which explodes on Shoemaker. Jean-Luc sprints over and picks up the kettle. &ldquo;Got your stupid helmet motherfucker!&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: you&rsquo;re right &mdash; so you should just leave it where it is. if you&rsquo;re carrying something stupid that makes you a stupid.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc [intimidation 15] (&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the equivalent of giving the bear the middle finger?&rdquo;) attempts to goad Shoemaker</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put that on if I were you; but i&rsquo;m gonna be over there in a second anyway and there&rsquo;s not much you can do about it&rdquo;. Jean-Luc pantomimes huge jaw hands like &ldquo;blah blah blah&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-Luc hears behind him the soft sifting noise of dirt behind him; the vase is erupting with soil and covers his boots and climbs up his body in a mound. he turns into a creature of pure physical flesh; a gelatinous pyramid; as the dirt recedes ; (from the outside he looks normal).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- afraid for at least 1 minute with a DC 17 Charisma throw.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez heals himself.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: I bet you too think that ability to heal yourself comes from nowhere?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: pass. you&rsquo;re talking nonsense.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: i wanted to have a sophisticated conversation about your belief system. &mdash; shoemaker bites Fez, and he doesn&rsquo;t slip on goo. but her saliva looks like normal saliva, not marjorie&rsquo;s greenish-white saliva.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: i want to play one of my favorite bear games. i killed a bear when i was only 3. and he takes out darts to shoot them.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: hieronymus, i knew you were a murderer: you&rsquo;ve been killing bears and bars and elves. and fish.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: well obviously i didn&rsquo;t kill a bear when i was three; i was still in the egg-womb with you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I was under the impression we counted ages after we hatched. i would rather not have to think about abortions, which are an egg-layer&rsquo;s right to choose.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: not in Marshbout it&rsquo;s not.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude (getting frazzled for some reason): well &mdash; marshbout is a large place &mdash; and &mdash; has a diversity of opinions (perhaps she&rsquo;s been wrestling with her pro-choice views after growing up as a monk)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: we can talk politics later. i&rsquo;m not exactly sure where you are at the moment.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: i&rsquo;m downstairs; i was just speaking with Eldar. a very very powerful little lady. i&rsquo;m not sure you know the extent of her hidden powers.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: there is no escape.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: well, i _have_ made my way out of the monastery. or we can see each other in a moment up there?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: no, i have &hellip; an appointment.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: oh, and it&rsquo;s covered? what is it for?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: no, dental is not.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: probably all the rich fatty and sugary urban fare you&rsquo;ve been eating. if you adhered to the dietary restrictions of the monastery it would just be grasses and natural plants and fruits.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: if you had any sense, you would know that i&rsquo;m going to get my teeth drilled. because i desire the pain.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: well have you considered dilettantes, because it would be more torturesome?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: but the professional knows exactly where to poke and prod</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: i suppose the difficulty is when they get so wrapped up in their technique&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: my dentist is a true maniac. he has no scruples whatsoever.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude. a rare combination indeed. i must offer you all the worst, then.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, i&rsquo;m in the middle of a game of darts now</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: by all means, throw the darts as hard as you may into your own extremities, as we play darts.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- both of Hiero&rsquo;s darts hit the bear; &mdash; Bear&rsquo;s eye! and he shoots directly for her eyes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Shoemaker: sometimes it&rsquo;s important to see what&rsquo;s hidden, but this really hurts.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero kills her very slowly. He hops onto her, and presses the darts deeper and deeper into her brain through her eyes. (thinking he&rsquo;s using time-manipulating magic) -- everyone else sees him shoot the darts, which go into random parts of her body (shoulder and ribs) but Hiero runs up anyway and smashes her eyes with his open palms. &ldquo;Time-Manipulating Magic!&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez and Hieronymus [DC 17 charisma check] . Hieronymus also turns into a flesh mound. might actually be one of his dreams as a flagellant, to be nothing but exposed nerves and muscles; unable to move.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Eldar&rsquo;s creepy whispers to Drav don&rsquo;t go unnoticed, and Drav shrieks in pain as Eldar reaches out to grab her hand again.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Eldar: If you wouldn&rsquo;t try to keep me hidden inside of you, I can promise that it wouldn&rsquo;t be so painful when I emerge. &mdash; the putrid rot of drav&rsquo;s flesh is evident.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav disengages and runs back behind Carlos.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick takes the opportunity to shoot at Eldar, this poor little dwarf spirit. Eldar becomes transparent and disappears as she whispers to Drav &ldquo;don&rsquo;t allow them to keep suppressed within you what is your greatest power!&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick tries to shatter the vase with a regular arrow. the arrow pings harmlessly off it, despite its appearing to be made of glass.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Drav: i think it has some kind of magical protection on it. Carlos is my best friend. (Drav and Carlos hug each other). We may need to cast dispel magic on it.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude shouts: Which one is &hellip; &ldquo;shithead&rdquo; ?</div>\n</section>"}

Vengeance is just thinking about how hungry he is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick 15 survival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the same amount was on the bite he took, it wouldn't kill him. \"He must have really let his guard down to be sold a poisoned hot dog.\" The scuffle marks around the area indicate three assailants, and the wheels of a trolley that lead back into an alleyway.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick walks back into the&nbsp;ruelle&nbsp;which opens up into a courtlet that's being used for refuse; there are upturned barrels and crates. She does see a trolley.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap looks for logos or symbols on the trolley, which actually appears to have been painted recently in red and yellow stripes, indicating it may have been the hogdog trolley. He doesn't see any sign of a creature being dragged; it's just cobblestones and hard to pick up a trail. He surveys the walls of the court, and notices a face peeking out from some slatted blinds. Attempting to be inconspicuous, Jaap lets the rest of the group know that someone is watching them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg has to will himself to keep from squaring his shoulders and glaring directly at the indicated window. (He's also taught his muscles to ignore the dictates of his will, though.)&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Group stealth check. Resigned guffaws. Drav's bad day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav slaps the sides of the cart, \"Hey, look at this weird trolley, what's with that?!\" She's strong that the aluminum echoes within the enclosed area. The face in the window disappears.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everybody make a perception check.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">the chase</h2>\n<p>Jaap runs \"they're getting away!\" and begins to run after the creature. Flick takes off after Jaap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick runs after him, draws her bow, [used a bonus action to activate Planar Warrior] in order to shove at distance. The diminitude of the creature and his familiarity with his surroundings causes her first shot to go wide. The second shot is true, and he goes sprawling onto the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick in a monotone says \"Wait, no, stop.\" He loops back at Flick, his pointy features creating a brutalist silhouette out of which fiery red eyes glow, all crowned by a deep black top-knot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: \"Only the guilty run.\"</p>\n<p>A man in a chef's outfit comes out balancing seven boxes of hogdogs and hogdog buns (\"sliced rolls\"); Pjorg takes both of his legs out at the ankles, and he goes ass over teakettle as the hogdogs firework from their boxes.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>r&uacute;n gearrth&oacute;ir (roon gar hor) (rune cutter)</p>\n<p>Sleight of hand ... 20</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg grabs a hogdog right out of the air. He then Dashes to catch up to the course. He smashes into the goblin, crab-crawling backwards, and pins him to the ground with the weight of his armor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goblin, claiming he's just running out for ingredients, has to get back to the rising rolls to stick the hogdogs on top with mustard glue. Pjorg suggests a split roll, and accuses the goblin of \"primitive\" culinary techniques. The goblin takes this as anti-goblin sentiment and asks if Pjorg is associating himself with \"the tall ones\" to which Pjorg replies \"I am a tall one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror lately?\" \"no. what is a mirror\" \"A reflective surface\" \"I don't look at reflections because they show things that aren't true.\" \"Your armor's quite shiny tho.\" \"Am i looking at it?\" \"Uhh wouldn't you have to to polish it?\" \"No.\" \"Maybe seek out a window or lake or something...\" \"Friends, he's a hogdog guy. He's getting hogdog things. Shall I keep him pinned to the ground.\" Flick: Yes, please.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_5\">the interrogation</h2>\n<p>Get off! Look, I'll pay you for your idea about the split rolls, ok, is that why you're holding me here? asks the panicked goblin. No, I'm merely reclining in leisure, says Pjorg. What about you? (looking at Jaap) first can you tell this guy he's not tall and then ask him to get off of me. Sure, but point blank, yo, why are you trying to poison our friend with a hogdog? Jaap asks. (Looking at Pjorg) Poison? He doesn't look poisoned to me, he looked like he thought the hogdog was delicious. It was! says Pjorg. A different friend. Someone you previously sold a hogdog to, clarified Jaap. Hey man, we have a no-return policy. Oh, but this is not about returns. This is about somebody who got kidnapped after eating a bad hogdog. Probably ... we found some poison on the hogdogs. Look, Glittering, my hogdogs are so good I can see them being used as bait, but I don't know what you're talking about.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight checks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They can immediately tell that he's lying.</p>\n<p>Jaap: Don't tell me any lies now. WHy were you trying to poison and kidnap our friend.</p>\n<p>Hey! Look, I didn't kidnap anybody. When somebody says they are going to give you fifty gold to put their own mustard on a hotdog you take the coin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can understand that, Jaap replies. Can you describe this person to us?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, sure, they were humans, wearing these fancy masks, they came all the way into the house, there were beads on them, maybe different colors. Their clothes were quite nice, they didn't look like aristocrats but they were definitely well-off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: Is there anything&nbsp;else&nbsp;that you can tell us? Were they speaking with an accent or other thing out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p>Goblin: Yeah, they cast a spell where I couldn't hear anything at all, so I just kind of got out of there. They'd given me the gold earlier, you see, when I'd put the mustard on the hogdog. It seemed like they had a bit of money to throw around. They gave me the money in the house and told me to take the trolley into the street when I got cued and offer the hogdog.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: What did the mark look like?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Goblin: Oh, he was handsome. Beatiful flowing golden locks, well-tanned face, well-built, lithe</p>\n<p>Flick: After you gave the hotdog to him what happened?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Goblin: I think he just ... went willingly with them?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick and Jaap can tell he's hiding something.</p>\n<p>Flick leans down, I'm going to give you a chance to answer that question again, and I want the truth this time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblin: Ok, look, I wasn't lying, his body was willing but the spirit was weak, if you get my drift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: I do not.</p>\n<p>Goblin: He basically just passed out after starting to defend himself. The silence was right after I gave him the hotdog. It looked like he opened his mouth to try to shout, but nothing came out.</p>\n<p>Flick: Where did they take him?</p>\n<p>Goblin: Off that way, east.</p>\n<p>Flick: I'm Not going to leave him at the mercy of these Hat Basket motherfuckers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap: How many people were there?</p>\n<p>Goblin: I saw three of them, who ended up dragging him off.</p>\n<p>Pjorg yawns and lazily gets off him and helps him up. One day you'll be as big as I am I hope for your sake, and claps him too hard on the back.</p>\n<p>Gimpel: Like, I'll have the same armor as you that makes you look a lot wider?</p>\n<p>Pjorg: Of course, small one.</p>\n<p>Gimpel: I'm a chef and a vendor, there's really no need.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: I see it distinctly in your future.</p>\n<p>Gimpel: Are you a divinator?</p>\n<p>Pjorg: I don't know the meaning of the word. I just know that someone who sells such good hogdogs has a real place in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gimpel: I know that Maryatt's been having some intense stomach pains, and I was hoping for a divinator or something to determine who'd placed a curse on her or draw the evil out.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: You say your an artist who draws evil?</p>\n<p>Gimpel: I suppose I was speaking figuratively, meaning, to cure her.</p>\n<p>Pjorg: I understand. Enjoy your life of adventure, hogdogman.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Survival check for tracking clues<br />Drav Insight/religion : 10</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"toc_6\">tracking the kidnappers</h2>\n<p>Flick is convinced that Hogdogman Gimpel is largely innocent, starts looking for signs in the road, looking for a sign of a person being carried or dragged by three others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Walking down this street where Gimpel had pointed, there are cobblestones with guttering between them; the mud in the gutters turns to dust on the stones, and there is a great deal of fish refuse from the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"8BNOPdjrju4VlYFd\"> Magnificent Sandford Fishing Jostle &amp; Menagerie</a>. They can see somehow has been dragged down the street and hoisted up on a cart, and the cart tracks can be followed up north, and then out northwest as though to travel out of the city on a western route.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: They're absconding with him!</p>\n<p>Drav goes to touch the stones and hears very faint whispers and can't tell where they are coming from.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investigation 22.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds to Drav like the stones are starting to communicate with her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rocks: \"This way, this way, dragged this way.\" They can't communicate all that much, except directionally. They direct them \"out to the country\" at the point the trail goes that way. It doesn't seem to be sandstone, but rather common river stones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: Hey, the stones told me he went this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick: The stones ... told ... you ?</p>\n<p>Drav: Well, we'll see what happens, I guess.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On this trajectory, it's impossible to tell if there's a specific location they're heading for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick takes off at a trot in the direction</p>\n<p>JL: I worry we might not be the crusaders of truth and justice we think we are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_7\">Surf and turf</h2>\n<p>Vengeance is still fishing off the pier.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception / Religion</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He feels a strange vibration around his neck, and suddenly he realizes the necklace he made out of JL's toenails is beginning to jitter and rotate around his neck, and stretching out and trying to pull in a direction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance goes where it takes him and doesn't struggle. \"It's finally happening. This is what I've been waiting for\" he thinks to himself. \"I don't remember why I made this necklace, but it's clearly being realized.\" It must be a taco detector, taking him to more good fish. He does pass ... close ... to the trendy fish taco wagon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"My sister Leema has another trendy taco wagon up there, make sure you visit it.\"</p>\n<p>There was also a species of fish that Schlonzel had told Vengeance had a foot fetish .. in the sense that they ate toenails. But now he thinks Schlonzel must have been putting him on, and that's why he never caught fish, and he always tried toenail bait.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Soon he encounters the rest of the adventuring party (sans JL)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>V: So I guess one of you has the tacos that I'm looking for? It's tilapia or nothing. he asks the group. It has to have the right sauce, spices, and herbs. It has to be zesty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The necklace Vengeance is wearing is almost horizontal to the ground, pointing in the direction they think JL is.</p>\n<p>Come on, everyone, this way to delicious fish!</p>\n<p>Flick isn't following him based on that, but he knows vengeance to be a \"Vortex of strange fortuitous happenings\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He runs up the street, but kind of has to keep tacking a bit. Vengeance starts salivating so much...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DEX save</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the saliva mixes with the fascia of the fish skin, he surfs on the street, but ends up smashing into a building. \"Surf and Turf!\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Angela suggests De-Motivation points that let you replace enemy rolls.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"toc_8\">Jean-Luc</h2>\n<p>JL is sitting tied up in a stables, speaking to a woman wearing (horse) riding clothing who appears to be breathing a bit hard, and has just let him know that \"without the ledge of Pathytus your companions will have to do their own accounting: Of your body parts!!\"</p>\n<p>JL thinks that Vengeance would enjoy that. With her watching it might be too difficult to get out of the ropes. \"This isn't going to work out the way you want it to.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You're making some assumptions about the way I want it to work out, Tishara replies.</p>\n<p>My companions and I have an unfortunate habit of 'asking questions later'. on the other hand, if you let me go, perhaps I can get them to get you to give you the ledger peacefully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tishara: At this point you're assuming that I don't want your companions too.</p>\n<p>JL: If you wanted all of us here, you probably wouldn't just have kidnapped me. Now you're just a sitting target. You guys need to get better at this -- as a thieves' guild you're a little lacking. (JL is annoyed at the lack of professional courtesy he's being shown)&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good persuasion roll.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Look, mother's choice of my profession may not have been perfect, but in order to get what I'm owed I do have to pursue it in my own way, so I'm sorry I'm not doing this perfectly! This estate has more than enough resources to entrap someone who comes to your aid.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: Well if you have these resources there's way better ways to get the Ledger, for Glob's sake.</p>\n<p>Tishara: How dare you take the name of Glob in vain, here! And the estate's resources are not mine to use outside the pale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: That is a very nice saddle on the wall there --</p>\n<p>TV: Don't look at that saddle. (She hustles over quickly and arranges a cloth over it)</p>\n<p>JL: That's a very nice cloth; your riding clothes scream \"professional horse show\" which isn't something the peasants participate in, so this Ledger, whatever it is, I can only assume it's important to your quite well connected family. But this is a poor way to go about getting it.</p>\n<p>TV: I've had to make certain accommodations; I have to keep the resources&nbsp;on&nbsp;the estate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: Are you saying you're not liquid. Because I know a lot about commercial real estate: i could find some good investment properties for you.</p>\n<p>TV: well when I come into my own , it will all be mine to use as I desire, but for now I don't have claim over the domain; i have to make use of it&nbsp;in situ</p>\n<p>JL: Oh this is one of those \"mother won't let me control the purse strings\" kinds of things? That's a bit disappointing.</p>\n<p>TV: Yes, it's boring to me too!</p>\n<p>JL: I was at least hoping you'd be a revolutionary; you're just a spoiled trust fund brat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TV: Revolutionary? What are&nbsp;you&nbsp;revolutioning against?</p>\n<p>JL: You know, stand up for the people, overthrow the patriarchy. What is so important about this ledger anyway.</p>\n<p>TV: Sure, in certain respects it's a ledger of mih q'guphyn, that ancient sorcerer whose ledgers were sought after for decades and ended up being entirely useless, but I do know that, at least according to my mother, and me getting it for her will prove that I'm a worthy daughter and will inherit the property when it comes time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: If i may be so bold, who else is in line for this inheritance.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PERSuasion.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL has played out this line --</p>\n<p>TV: Well, that's family business. And you've reminded me --</p>\n<p>She walks towards him and places an amulet around his neck. It looks like it's silver and turqoise colored amulet, with this insignia (?)&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>History 18</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL, in school he took an elective on anti-magic, being opposed to the idea that magic was a useful power or force in the world, and he associates this symbol with anti-detection</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_9\">Hunger of Fish-dar</h2>\n<p>Miles away, Vengeance's necklace falls to his chest and stops pulling him forward. He reaches into his bag and pulls out a dead angler fish. This is what I was looking for all along.</p>\n<p>Leema's Fancy Fish High Fanciness Food Truck is glaring at him, but the necklace is no longer pointing \"at\" it, but it did stop here. He peers into a building with the shingle The Bezzler's Edge (someone into shady finances or someone who sharpens knives?) but when he looks inside given the number of leather bound tomes and sharp edges it might be both; maybe someone who defends their shady activities with martial skill. He is fairly close to the outskirts of the city.</p>\n<p>V calls his companions over. Let's look around, that fish taco has to be around here somewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investigation 12.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After V's hunger is satisfied, he can reflect and think it probably wasn't just pointing to a fish truck. It's really his hunger that's been taken him on a journey. (he didn't catch anything at the pier, but even small children were pulling out lengthy specimens).</p>\n<p>\"I suppose my mind was just clouded by hunger, but now I know we are in the vicinity of Jean-Luc, with whom I share a special bond, and best-friendliness, as I'm sure he would agree\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc's ears start burning red and he shakes his head, miles away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_10\">Ash the Crow</h2>\n<p>Flick looks at the direction Vengeance was pointing in when the necklace failed. She takes stock of the wildlife around; farmland circumscribes the town boundaries, which gives way to the hills out west, and swamp up north. She emits a series of coos, caws, rattles, and clicks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick casts Speak with Animals and invites the crows over to him.</p>\n<p>Flick knows they are \"humble but also proud\" and asks a favor, if they are willing, would one of them follow the path of a wagon that passed not too long ago with an unconscious man in the back of it, and if they could show me.</p>\n<p>After some time, Ash the Crow flies down. \"I am Ash, do you have The Sparklies?\" Flick pulls out a lot of shiny bronze currency with a hole punched in the middle of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ash steps gingerly over and pokes at them forcefully. \"These will do nicely. Ka-Kaw!\" Seven other crows come down and grab a piece. Ash, pieceless, comes to Flick's shoulder and rests his head against hers. \"You may proceed with your incantation.\"</p>\n<p>And she whispers in sylvan 'May your sight be mine though your will remains your own' to cast Beast Sense to sense through their sensorium.</p>\n<p>Flick: Please find my friend and many more shinies will be yours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick can tell that Ash can smell Jean-Luc, and acts somewhat like a bloodhound, picking up scents, then flying low to the ground and quickly. (For Flick, it's \"slightly disorienting to have two streams of experience, but she can get used to it\" and says \"well wherever JL's been taken, it must be some kind of compound, or house, out here, Ash will be able to give us the lowdown on it. But to make the best use of our time we should follow behind.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_11\">The horse trough</h2>\n<p>Knowing that Flick is a ranger, he's not all that worried, since they haven't used magic to track anyone, so doesn't think the Amulet will prevent their efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: I get it, you captured me and tied me up, I respect that, kind of, but I'm thirsty, could you get me some water. And maybe another one of those Kriobolitan sausages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TV: What sausages? but as for the water, yes, I can accommodate. (She picks up the back of his chair and spins it on a leg, and dunks his head into the water of the trough back there.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CON save.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He sees this coming and holds his breath</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investigation check. How much is her pretending to be a hard-boiled thief, and how much is her being a trust-fund kid in over her head?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As she approached him, she was trying to keep herself from getting wet, and the natural action of pulling him back out of the trough covers her in water.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL settles in, knowing they've dealt with scarier foes, and waits for his friends to arrive. Tishara misreads his endurance as scared silence.</p>\n<p>\"I can see that cowed you,\" she says, \"as I would expect, for someone who's had such a soft upbringing as yourself.\"</p>\n<p>JL plays into it: Yeah, i'm sure my friends will give you whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Performance / Deception to lower her guard. it works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She looks like she relaxes a bit. \"Yes, that's what I thought. I guess we'll have to see what happens if they show up.\" And she leaves the stall.</p>\n<p>JL goes about loosening his bonds. He easily gets the ropes off of him. His equipment is nowhere to be seen. He cautiously approaches a window and looks out around the estate. He can see directly down the path towards Sandford. He can see some of the masts in the harbor; he's about 10 miles outside the town. Between him and there is a large horse pastrure; off to the right there is a guest house; the main house curves around to the right and back. Off to his left the Strigge River gives more context to the scene.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He tears a bit of his white shirt off, ties it outside the window, and re-ties his own ropes to make it look like he's secured.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_12\">May Glob be with you</h2>\n<p>By this point, the group is within 2 miles of the estate. Ash comes back and rests on Flick's shoulder. \"Before my speech is no longer as yours, tell me what you saw.\"</p>\n<p>Ash: I must thank you again for the sparklies. It appears the trail continues straight from here; we've wound through a few fields but it is a straight line; you should see in the distance an estate; i believe that is where the carriage has ended up.</p>\n<p>Flick: Did you see any men bearing steel beaks or crow killers? (That's how they understand bows and swords, says Flick to herself)</p>\n<p>Ash: If you'll give me just a few moments; he flies upwards in a spiral. Unfortunately, I agreed to this service, but I'm a bit of an elder crow and my vision isn't what it used to be; it was tough for me to see how many were milling about the estate. I saw not a few shapes. Be careful.</p>\n<p>Flick: We always are. (And gives him three more coins)</p>\n<p>Ash: A true bounty! I will remember you. How do you call yourself in the crow language?</p>\n<p>Flick makes a bunch of clicks and caws.</p>\n<p>Ash: the clicks could use some work, but I get the gist.</p>\n<p>Flick: Well I don't speak it very often</p>\n<p>Ash: No, you shouldn't be embarrassed; very few do; but if you ever wish to learn the language, we do consider one of our sites of power to be Wrentop which, yes, is named for wrens, but we kind of co-habitate it, and feel free to visit any time, there is much room after a great exodus of some of the creatures there about a year ago, and we would love to repopulate.</p>\n<p>Flick: What happened at Wrentop?</p>\n<p>Ash: There was a distant explosion, and it drew like a magnet some who lived under the ground there, and they went to investigate and did not return to the hills.</p>\n<p>Flick: Thank you, I won't forget this.</p>\n<p>Ash: May Glob be with you.</p>\n<p>Flick: And also with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_13\">Crossing Old Five Clan Road</h2>\n<p>Flick: Well, there isn't no one at the estate, but we should be able to take them. What do you say we teach these guys not to mess with us.</p>\n<p>Jaap: You bet, let's get them.</p>\n<p>Flick: Alright, I like the spirit!&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick Perception 2 miles away</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pjorg, lost in his ledger, isn't good at tracking, and also doesn't care, he's just going beacuse it's interesting. He's also done enough eye-pushups that he's able to see slightly further than he otherwise would be able to. (And he has higher resolution because his \"ocular\" has been shrunken down into a smaller \"retina\".)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The estate is not built to blend into its surroundings. They can't anymore details that there are a grouping of buildings nestled in a crook of the river. There are trees to the east and west, but in between it's very nice horse pasture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And, as Pjorg believes, Ys is flat. And it's runes all the way down.</p>\n<p>Flick doesn't shun people for incorrect opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They come across Old Five Clan Road; the old dwarven road leading to the coast.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CHA saves from Vengeancea and Flick. Flick fails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Flick steps onto the road, and immediately everything around her goes grey and foggy, as though she's been transported to the ethereal plane. Vengeance sees that the blades of his selfkiller start to glow with an intense yellow-white light; but as soon as the glow peaks in intensity, it dims again to a rusty grey.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaap insight ++. Drav rolls --</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To those watching, Flick disappeared. Jaap doesn't suspect that there are forces immediately looking to kidnap Flick. Pjorg doesn't think he's been ambushed again. Drav is still obsessed with the rocks around here, of which she's found a few good ones, without getting any whispers back; tldr she is unaware that Flick has disappeared.</p>\n<p>As soon as things go grey, Flick looks behind her. Her companions look like Take On Me drawings, verry foggy and out of focus. She can't feel the \"doorway in her head\" feeling that she can open and get back into the prime, but she's not feeling it right now. (Based on Flick's limited experimentation, the Ethereal Plane is like a series of infinite perpenticular pocket planes that infinitely overlap and are perpendicular to the prime, but only extend a certain distance in any particular direction. So she couldn't walk over to the estate.)&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The DM clarifies that Flick&nbsp;would&nbsp;be able to travel to the estate, or a distance, and that walking through the plane is continuous, but the person travels with a sort of \"fog of war\" or spotlight following them.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where her foot landed, though, on the road, is a brilliant, glittering, silver imprint of her foot (also known as a footprint). As she looks south and north, she sees that the road boundaries are a similar, if more muted, version of that argent luminosity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick crosses the road and steps off it; nothing changes in her general environment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Drav fails arcana ability check. CON save.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav takes a break from probing the stones to look up at where Flick had been. She sees footprints showing up in the dirt and dust of the Old Five Clan Road. To her they present as golden footprints. As they solidify and then fade out, she hears a myriad of voices which sound like ancient, deep dwarven voices speaking in antiphony (call and response between two equal-sized groups, almost). Drav is overwhelmed by this, and passes out and flops over.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jaap medicine check (20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap comes over and examines Drav who, though physically unharmed, yet, in addition to having fainted, bears the superficial signs of an intense psychological conflict (in his view, perhaps, having tapped into some kind of collective unconscious).</p>\n<p>Jaap brings out his favorite caterpillar urine salts. As the acrid scents make their way into her nose and sensorium, she sees herself as if from above sitting at the edge of the road as and endless column of dwarves marches northwards past her. They wear clothing she's never seen before except in old tomes where she's researched the armor from past ages, thousands of years ago. Drav reaches out in an attempt to make contact, but her arm passes through the figures. As she continues watching, suddenly panic contorts their features, and they begin to run. The road further south suddenly buckles and warps and rises up in huge ribbons of sand-colored flesh, and a gigantic maw of some kind of snake or dragon lunges towars her and the dwarves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She wakes up to see in focus a caterpillar butt and Jaap behind, holding it. (By accident, Jaap was infected with a caterpillar virus that gave him certain extra caterpillar glands in his armpits.)&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick Perception 21</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She's looking at the road and back towards the group and casts detect portal. She gets a case of goosepimples; when she turns around. Because of the distance, in the Ethereal Plane, she couldn't make out what was going on, but the magnitude strikes her. She sees a helix of energy rising into the air from a little hill off to the side of the estate. In the helix, she sees this, blasting a path towards her eyes through the fog of the EP, the other strand looks like it's drawing life and color and energy from the material plane. At the very top it looks like an upside-down tornado that converges up in the atmosphere. The more she looks, the more it looks like a hurricane.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is it a nexus point for a ton of different planes? No. At this point, the boundary between the material plane and the ethereal plane has been eradicated, at the tip of that inverted tornado.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick believes she was pulled into the ethereal plane, that planar overlap is extending weakly out from that point. She tries to \"step rigt next to her friends\" on the material planes, hoping to maybe piggyback on this boundary erasure. (like straining to attend to a single voice in a loud room).&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She \"accidentally\" uses Misty Step to do this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick finds herself stepping into the material plane. She waves at her friends in a bemused and slightly terrified show of good humor. Pjorg lets out a hearty chuckle: \"oh small one, you became so small that we couldn't see you. Tell me, what's it like to see everything so large?\"</p>\n<p>Flick: It's really something Pjorg, she says, chuckling in an exaggerated show of good humor. Pjorg: Indeed, I describe many things as something. Flick: Almost everything is something. Pjorg: But some things are not. Something means everything to me.</p>\n<p>Flick immediately turns her attention back to the point where the helix was in the material plane. She perceives the area as slightly out of focus, but for the most part it looks like a large grassy hill with significant bald spots on it, behind a sprawling estate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I certainly think Jean-Luc is in some particular danger, FLick says, and takes off towards the estate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg takes a minute, because he's seen runesl&auml;tingar perform \"The Stony Step\" and jump between two rocks with runes on them. He's unable to see runes of that nature when he closely examines the points of Flick's appearance and disappearance. He does think, tho, that maybe one of the stones had a rune carved, but he would be very hard pressed to tell what it was.</p>\n<p>Drav investigates the stones too.</p>\n<p>Don't bother looking, dwarf, there's nothing there, Pjorg says cocksurely in an attempt to obviate the search.</p>\n<p>Despite Pjorg's supercilious handwaving, Drav sees the [&lt;T] symbol, the one identified with Ten-Axe Bloodsledge in the Archives, carved into a great number of the rocks forming the outer edges of the road. She gets the feeling it may have been a protective magic against the dragon, or the Desert ecosystem itself. She also sees the pong [ ] symbol carved into a few of the rocks on the interior of the road. Pjorg has never seen this before, and neither has Drav.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg thinks: this is obscure-on-obscure shit, off the beaten path (though not literally), so it's understandable that he doesn't recognize it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance takes a look at his self-killer as it glows, likewise seeing a [ ] symbol, A RUNE SO PROFOUND, the open-triangle pinwheel, the auto-rune, the logo, that looks similar to the self-killer itself, and the wings with eyes. Flick is hustling pretty hard by now for Jean-Luke. The winglike symbol looks very familiar to Vengeance on a religion check.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Flick remembers that the fish taco Flick bought had a delicious taste profile, incorporating saffron foam. )</p>\n<p>I feel like Jean-Luc should be looking (luc-ing?) for&nbsp;us, Vengeance claims. Is it really our responsibility to go looking for him every time he disappears. ALL THE TIMES. Something tells me he's not doing his berst to escape and find us. I don't know. Maybe he could be trying a little harder.</p>"}

A deal with Vek. Fez can't fake it. Cyrowan, the reluctantly silent squire. Up into the sunlight and towards the Big Hedge. Absquatulating with Aphelia? Shut in by Seomra.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h1>Transcript</h1>\n<div>- Vek: Flick&rsquo;s apology meant quite a lot to me.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Vek, do you remember a younger me when you knew Shoemaker.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Shoemaker was more like the curator of a museum with a lot of travelling exhibits. Occasionally we&rsquo;d get spirits from overseas. There were elves that came through there, sometimes druids; we did get a lot of creatures, hermits, ascetics. As an elf you&rsquo;re &hellip;</div>\n<div>- Flick: I&rsquo;m 75. (So, a young adult)</div>\n<div>- Vek: I don&rsquo;t remember you coming into that basement, and I&rsquo;m fairly sure we&rsquo;ve not interacted before this.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Do you remember (Lupenna&rsquo;s description) [Bad Persuasion role]</div>\n<div>- Vek: I certainly do get a lot of werecreatures, lycanthropes and things. It&rsquo;s rumored that I can cure that disease. It takes more than the power I have, because that&rsquo;s an agreement made with the natural cycles &mdash; almost behind the creature&rsquo;s back. I largely allow people to look inside themselves. I can offer certain remediations to an unwilling shapechanger. It is possible.</div>\n<div>- Flick: You may be with us longer than you intend to be.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Just any place outside should do to dump me in! And a glassblower with 50-60 years of training in order to properly break down the vase.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Was this part of the agreement, guys?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: It seems like a thing we&rsquo;d agree to.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Do you remember when we were trying to liberate Aphelia from Seomra so we could return the music to the Peryton? Where did that end up?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I&rsquo;m just along for the ride, baby.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Someone had their abilities sucked out of them? That sounds like precisely what they may have directed you here for. It&rsquo;s one of my talents to reintegrate the separated flesh and spirit, just as I can separate them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: What would you need to help us out with this?</div>\n<div>- Vek: You&rsquo;re right I don&rsquo;t do things for free; but as part of the intervention; I could certainly help with Jean-luc&rsquo;s increasing alcoholism. I don&rsquo;t know if the whole surprise intervention thing works; he&rsquo;d have to be a little bit on board.</div>\n<div>- Flick: I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s a problem that needs solving.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Typically I get to know people so well that I can gain knowledge that is useful to me; it is sufficient , kind of a pay what you will situation. I&rsquo;m glad to accept donations.</div>\n<div>- Flick:We&rsquo;ve gained a spirit therapist with the voice of A&rsquo;Leh &ldquo;The Goon&rdquo; Kihs</div>\n<div>When Vek speaks, it unintentionally spits bits of soil out of the lidless vase. Flick covers the lid with the mildly sticky fizzlecyst webbing, forgoing the use of a hammock spied in a backroom. Survival and perception checks indicate to Fez and Flick that there could be an entity in the subbasement&rsquo;s pool. If it hasn&rsquo;t come up by now it probably won&rsquo;t. If the door is barred, they should be safe. Flick has lingering anxiety about smoldering wood, and scurries about stamping out any charred pieces of wood.</div>\n<div>LONG REST begins</div>\n<div>Jean-luc thinks to himself that he enjoys a good drink, and maybe hits the bottle harder than others, but recently he&rsquo;s started to doubt whether or not he&rsquo;s a verified alcoholic.</div>\n<div>Fez [Wis save] Abzu had mentioned something about the Talleacht; while dreaming, these tall pale humanoid creatures, known from childhood stories describing ghouls or ghasts; look like they have gills and webbing. A nightmare of a few of these creatures wandering up from the sub basement pool (still green pool with algae on top), algae covers them like strands; they make their way up the stairs and come stand before you.</div>\n<div>- Talleacht. Fez! Why aren&rsquo;t you coming for us? Why aren&rsquo;t you saving us?</div>\n<div>- Fez: I don&rsquo;t know who you are.</div>\n<div>- Talleacht: Fez! Seek out the Talleacht. We are the Gormflaith. Why have you abandoned your fellow sailors?</div>\n<div>Fez startles awake, and they disappear.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance [Con save fail] CON and CHA decrease by three due to the Boils spreading. He wakes up in the middle of the night shivering from a fever; the neuropathy is worse; the boils have started to spread across his body; and he&rsquo;s having trouble breaking.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I think i know what the problem is. I have to go downstairs and take a dip. I used to swim every day in the @JournalEntry[rmcfV0H0Sgc8PrbO]{icy ponds of Cromfldldor}; that&rsquo;s how I felt my best self; and I haven&rsquo;t felt my best self since then. I just need a nice refreshing swim, so I&rsquo;m going to pop down there and do a few laps if you fellas don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Well don&rsquo;t let me stop you.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Before you go some of those boils look pretty &mdash; uhf. Do you mind if I put a salve on them?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Well, they do hurt. it&rsquo;d be nice if you could pop them like a bubble wrap.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: It&rsquo;s going to burn a little (but it actually burns a lot)</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Bring it on, brother.</div>\n<div>Fez brings out a primarily alcohol-based salve and then &ldquo;heals disease.&rdquo; The boils subside somewhat, and the delicious warm feeling of burning alcohol spreads throughout the wound, and he regains 1 points each of CON and CHA.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Well perhaps I don&rsquo;t need that swim after all.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: It&rsquo;s an excellent salve; I made it myself</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Could you give me the recipe?</div>\n<div>- Fez: I think I remember what it was, but it requires a still and the necessary amount of sailor&rsquo;s grog.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: That I'm afraid I don&rsquo;t have. I&rsquo;d have to ask Jean-luc, our drunkard friend.</div>\n<div>- Fez: He does know how to put it away, doesn&rsquo;t he.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I&rsquo;m not sure he &ldquo;knows how&rdquo;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc is over in the corner sleeping soundly. Fez [makes DC 15 wisdom check with nat 20?], while applying the salve, his fingers feel strange and rubbery for a minute, but as he continues to rub it into the gross boils, he explains it to himself as having to do with how disgusting Vengeance&rsquo;s skin is.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: On second thought, maybe I&rsquo;ll dip my toe in the water and see how it feels.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance makes his way downstairs, Flick quietly tracking him, while the sounds of a flute issue from the bar. Vengeance plays a horrible screwing racket on his bagpipes. Vengeance makes it to the pool which emits a lurid and noxious green light. The pool is almost 100 feet long, and the room is entirely visible due to the glow. As Vengeance gets down to the pool, he sees, standing 30 feet away, a figure of a teenage boy, wearing a dark green robe over tattered hide armor.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: I&rsquo;m looking for Sir Master Fezziwig Hornswoggle!</div>\n<div>Vengeance plays his mournful nightswimming theme on his bagpipes. [nat 20?] .&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Are you saying he&rsquo;s dead? Your bagpipe playing conveys so much, even your name!</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I was hoping to take a solitary swim, and you&rsquo;re harshing my buzz, so if you could kind of scram, little boy.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Yes, I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m always getting in the way of people. Is the body of Lord Fez somewhere that I could still view it?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Since when did he become a lord?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: I&rsquo;m not sure of his title, but I know that he&rsquo;s renowned throughout the world?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I think he&rsquo;s just upstairs.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: How should I prepare myself to see him? Is he in a casket, or a mausoleum?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I think he&rsquo;s just having a drink up there in the bar. He&rsquo;s definitely still alive.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: why were you playing such a sad dirge for him.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: That was just for my swimming ritual.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: OHHH! Well can i sidle past you here?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I&rsquo;ve already changed into my bathing costume made of sharp and spiny hair.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Why do you have the hairs pointing inwards towards yourself?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I sometimes like to do it that way; it provides better insulation.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: And what&rsquo;s going on with your hands? It looks like a dead person&rsquo;s skin.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: No, that&rsquo;s just my normal hands&hellip;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: I&rsquo;m sorry, I shouldn&rsquo;t be so judgmental. I&rsquo;ll get out of your way &mdash; the water&rsquo;s quite tepid.</div>\n<div>Vengeance dips his toe in to discover the water is room temperature.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Little boy, do you know any freezing spells, something to take the water temperature down a bit?</div>\n<div>Cyrowan&rsquo;s eyes roll back in his head.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: [deep voice] Ye [regular voice] s I do have something like that. What would you like frozen?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Maybe a swimming lane?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: It&rsquo;s really just a cube this big.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: FINE I&rsquo;ll just paddle around in circles.</div>\n<div>Vengeance [Arcana fail] is distracted by a rebar pole in the wall; meanwhile Cyrowan creates a five foot cube of ice just under Vengeance&rsquo;s feet floating in the pool.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Will this do for you? If you give me a minute or so I could cover more of a line for you?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Ok, here goes.</div>\n<div>Vengeance puts on his splintery wooden goggles and jumps into the pool. The water chills quickly near to the ice cube; it does get satisfactorily cold within a few minutes. Meanwhile, Cyrowan, making his way up the stairs fitfully, sneaks surreptitious glances back at Vengeance.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Come on in everybody, the water&rsquo;s terrible?</div>\n<div>Vengeance&rsquo;s voice is so quiet that it doesn&rsquo;t even reverberate back to him &mdash; has his larynx frozen up, as had been his intent? Flick makes it back to the room before Cyrowan. Carlos is praying fervently, and Jean-luc is slumped over the table.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Sorry to wake you up, bud.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Did you make breakfast?</div>\n<div>- Flick: Not yet, but something came out of the radiant pool downstairs and is asking about you. I would bet it&rsquo;s the same kind of creature as the ones disguised as people from our past. Fez leaps up, grabbing weapons and armor. Without waking the dwarves, Flick moves the upturned table on which Drav and Carlos are sleeping. Flick positions herself behind Fez but in the limits of his aura. Jean-luc is still sleeping behind the bar, as far as possible from the door, in the hammock.</div>\n<div>They see the pale, tow-headed figure, black-eyebrowed, unarmed figure of Cyrowan, in tattered leather armor, poke his head around the door frame.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan (taking a knee and bowing his head in front of Fez): Lord Sir Fezziwig Hornswoggle, it&rsquo;s such an honor to meet you!</div>\n<div>- Fez: Just call me &lsquo;Sir Fezziwig Hornswoggle&rsquo;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Yes, whatever you desire, of course!</div>\n<div>- Fez: And what is your name?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: My name? It&rsquo;s hardly worth mentioning. The name of one so lowly as myself &hellip;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Nice to meet you, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s-Hardly-Worth-Mentioning&rsquo;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Oh, sir, quite a wit on you! It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve sought you out over the land, high low east west top bottom</div>\n<div>- Fez: But your name&hellip;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: It&rsquo;s Cyrowan sir c-y-r-o-w-a-n</div>\n<div>- Fez: I have very little use for letters</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Oh yes, a lack of need for letters is one of the signs of a great knight, how could I forget?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Why have you sought me out, as great as I am.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: I wish to become your squire. Precisely because of your reputation. I wish to become one who&rsquo;s skilled in the martial arts like yourself and do wonderful things.</div>\n<div>- Fez: What skills do you have? Any skills with a sword?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Yes, I can swing a sword capably.</div>\n<div>- Fez (tossing him a rapier): Show me what you got. This is a job interview.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: that&rsquo;s very kind sir but I want more than a job. I want to train with you and be an apprentice! I don&rsquo;t require any pay.</div>\n<div>- Fez (to the open room): Is &lsquo;apprentice&rsquo; a job?</div>\n<div>- Flick (hiding): &mdash;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Drav, Carlos, back me up here. Apprentice is a job, right?</div>\n<div>- Vek: From what I&rsquo;ve seen, an apprenticeship is more like a station in life rather than a job.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Are the mechanics of getting it similar?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Typically families send someone to a higher-status family. It&rsquo;s sort of a take it or leave it. The higher status people are always looking for servants, essentially.</div>\n<div>- Fez: What if I&rsquo;m &hellip; not.</div>\n<div>- Vek: I guess you have to tell him to piss off.</div>\n<div>- Fez; Ok, well, scary dirt monster says you have to piss off.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Who, sir? I heard that bag talking.</div>\n<div>- Fez: That&rsquo;s some kind of weird potted plant. I&rsquo;m not sure of the details. He &hellip; came in with a giant bear. He suggests that if I&rsquo;m not looking for a servant, that you should &ldquo;piss off&rdquo;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Please sir I&rsquo;ll do anything to be your apprentice, doing whatever you bid.</div>\n<div>- Fez: that does seem like a very useful service. Unfortunately staffing needs &hellip; in this economy. And our alcohol budget is going to go through the roof. I&rsquo;m not sure we have the resources, know-how, elbow-grease.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Sir in fact I provide my own way and even provide for you.</div>\n<div>- Fez: In that case you&rsquo;re hired. I teach you how to be great. The first: be luckier. Two: Every morning I will work on sparring with you and teach you how to fight. Three: A vow of silence. All of my apprentices take a vow of silence.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: Yes I&rsquo;ve heard of this. In fact I think I saw a monk downstairs. He was talking, but &hellip; we could still talk during the training? That sounds good to me, sir.</div>\n<div>Fez reaches out his hand. He and Cyrowan narrow down the terms of the vow of silence.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m weird, do you sir?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Absolutely not.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: I can still write things down?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yes. And the vow is also an expression of silence.</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan: So clever sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone tell me you&rsquo;re not the cleverest man on the planet.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan begins being silent. Fez, without alerting Cyrowan, uses Divine Sense. He doesn&rsquo;t detect celestials, fiends, or undead. Flick comes out from behind the table and begins trancing. Downstairs, Vengeance, feeling refreshed, jumps out of the pool and uses the piece of rebar to comb his few strands of hair while viewing his reflection in the pool. &ldquo;Alright Vengeance, you can do this,&rdquo; and adopts a karate pose. The laceration on his side splits open at this, bursting boils along the laceration and spreading the diseased tissue outwards from the center. Little piranha-like fish jumps from the pool and gobble up the exploding liquid. A frothy whirlpool appears as they go crazy.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I thought I wanted to freeze, but I guess I needed to BOIL, popping some boils and collecting the liquid in a vial.</div>\n<div>He runs upstairs to show his friends the vial, and asks if they&rsquo;d wish to go into business opening an apothecary with him.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Hey, the guy from before!</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yes, my squire: he has taken the customary vow of silence. It&rsquo;s great for building character and absorbing what the world has to offer.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: That&rsquo;s probably for the best &mdash; his voice was a little distracting.</div>\n<div>- Fez: That&rsquo;s definitely not why he took the vow.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Why was it then? He seemed to really like you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: I&rsquo;m trying to be a good teacher &mdash; I have to make a personal sacrifice because it&rsquo;s necessary for the learning process.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Vengeance, did you ever take a vow of silence?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I did take such a vow; however, I did eventually have to break it, mostly because I was screaming so hard during one particularly rigorous tortue sessions, so I figured, screw it, I don't need to keep this up.</div>\n<div>- Vek: So you thought that committing to a vow would prevent you from screaming? It had to be an external reinforcement?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t been very good at sticking to my decisions, but from now on I&rsquo;m going to. I&rsquo;m set on completing my quest.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: We did make quite a breakthrough! You wanted to become an oak tree, I said you had to become a grub first, then you were going to seek out a woman who transformed your beloved into a mule. I know I&rsquo;m gonna find something in you, and I promise you can find something in me.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: You seem like a really cool spirit.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yeah, me and this little wet dude are pretty cool together. we could be our own little sub-group.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Wet dude</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yeah, &hellip; the Cyrowan guy.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Oh I thought you said &ldquo;Rotrude&rdquo; and I got wistful.</div>\n<div>- Vek: You must have had quite the on-again off-again&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Sometimes I think about her and wonder what could have been.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance expresses sympathy for soil being paved over.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yeah I used to have a brother: Sek. He could manifest as soil too. That&rsquo;s what happened to him. Somebody poured him on some farmland, and covered it over. He&rsquo;s still stuck there to this day. Maybe your dwarf friends could help with that. I haven&rsquo;t heard from him in millenia.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vek begins to describe his multi-container claustrophobia, and how he needs to contract out a shaman to de-contain him if he&rsquo;s contained three times. Then he &ldquo;goes to the bathroom.&rdquo;</div>\n<div>[LONG REST actually completes]</div>\n<div>- Flick (to Vengeance): Was there a way further into the structure in the pool downstairs?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I didn&rsquo;t see exits, but I didn&rsquo;t dive down. I have to imagine that this dungeon goes down infinitely to the depths of hell. It just seems like that kind of place.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Yeah, even just one level down has proven very strange. I was to get back to Seomra and see if we can get Aphelia to come with us.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I&rsquo;m ready to get out of here as well.</div>\n<div>- Flick (to Jean-luc): You ready to go?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Yeah, thanks for the hammock. (Looks around) Did we pick up a new companion while I was out?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The rocks that Xanthu had used to block the exit are again crumbled on the floor. In the temple, Slugg and Balgarius are curled up sleeping together. Vengeance, existing the basement, and in combination with the Hairshirt and the ameliorative effects of the pool, the boils have subsided and all that remains is the healing laceration and the boil scars.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: I told you that salve would work.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Allow me to present you with this vial of pus. It&rsquo;s quite potent.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Please hand it to my new squire, who keeps all of my noxious boil materials.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Cool, so we&rsquo;re just going to be going through him now?</div>\n<div>- Cyrowan nods officiously. Not able to find a bag, he wraps the vial in his tattered clothing.</div>\n<div>- Fez: We&rsquo;ll find you a bag.</div>\n<div>Back to Seomra</div>\n<div>The group heads back to Seomra and the music room there. Only about a day and a half has passed. Empty leave plates with crumbs and fruits are scattered about; pitcher-plants hold various enticing liquids. Flick walks in, acting like she belongs in the place, but not owns the place, and casually sets Vek&rsquo;s container on a nearby projection.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (whispering): Vek, can you sense anything &ldquo;off&rdquo; about Aphelia. (Pointing out Aphelia)</div>\n<div>Flick [fails Intimidation] sees a number of the women run up to help her; Vek&rsquo;s vase is closed so no dirt closes.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Oh, if you can make sure that&rsquo;s not too close to the edge.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- long silver haired elf: Why are you here? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen you before.</div>\n<div>- Flick (pulling out her flute): I feel like Aphelia and I connected yesterday and I wanted to see if she had anything else to teach me.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick remembers that she had been starting to understand or translate Aphelia&rsquo;s sonic communications. She gives a quick flourish with the flute. Aphelia looks up and over at you. She glances quizzically at the vase. Flick holds out her hand in a placatory manner .</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- FLick (to Vek): She&rsquo;s who we&rsquo;re here to see. Does anything seem missing about her?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: There are odd vibrations in this room.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Are they coming from her or someone else?</div>\n<div>- Eth: oh, YOU! I thought you were already taken care of by the Simurgh.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&ldquo;here . time . now . is . preference &ldquo; (while disguising as casual noodling) [nat 20]&rdquo;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A smile creeps across her face. She plays deep bass notes, and any hair that hasn&rsquo;t fallen off by now does so; everyone returns to their original level of hairiness. she gets up and places a hand on Eth&rsquo;s shoulder. aphelia comes over and adopts a cross-legged style, which flick mirrors. she pushes flick&rsquo;s flute aside. I explain to her why we&rsquo;re there and impress upon her the daily horror that the gnolls are living under. I&rsquo;m not asking her to come with; we&rsquo;re going to fight the Peryton and bring it back.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Is she willing to entertain that being reintegrated with the Peryton (calliope) would end her existence as she knows it.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Last time she&rsquo;d said that she had amnesia and couldn&rsquo;t remember a prior life. But communicating through music she did indicate that she remembered the musical feeling of that time, and that it was something she longed for. (also, all this music stuff &hellip; ?)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (to Vek): could you effect this reunification in the wild?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I&rsquo;d have to see the flesh; there&rsquo;s so much missing here; i don&rsquo;t know that i&rsquo;ve ever seen a creature separated from its spirit outside my embrace. but the wild is, to me, just like an interior, except for all that claustrophobia stuff.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Aphelia isn&rsquo;t making a noise, but she&rsquo;s putting her hands over her ears and screaming.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: this is kinda out of my element.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Well, nothing to do but forge ahead.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Eth: what are you doing to her? She's very sensitive to vibrations. I don&rsquo;t know that anyone would like the sounds coming out of that vase. What have you got in there?</div>\n<div>- Vek: where are you putting me?</div>\n<div>- Eth: make sure you cinch the bag!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick puts Vek in the key pocket of the bag of holding.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: This is even more restrictive!</div>\n<div>- Eth: Thank you! Now what are you trying to get from Aphelia? She already said that she would go with you.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: It looks from the outside like we are a band of crazy people and &mdash; we are</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: but we mean well?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Aphelia connects eyes with Cyrowan and touches his lips. Cyrowan mimes being a squire for Fez. (Fez had asked for rabbits, and laughed at Cyrowan when he&rsquo;d fallen down on the way over).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc remembers a dream in which by putting the kettle on his head he is able to transform into a bear. Was Shoemaker under this spell? But she had stayed a bearlike creature after death. He did not sense anything malevolent during the dream. Vengeance meanwhile traverses the room to the piano, places Rotrude&rsquo;s handskin on the piano, saying, &ldquo;Ok, sister, one more time?&rdquo; and takes out his bagpipe to play. The gloves not animating themselves, Vengeance puts his hands inside and begins to play.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- What are you touching our piano with?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: It&rsquo;s normal, it&rsquo;s just me and my dead sister playing a duet.</div>\n<div>- Sister? You&rsquo;re just holding decaying matter in your hands.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: How dare you!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>One of the druids grapples the monk to the ground while another grabs his bagpipe.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- What are these things? This is something you&rsquo;re wearing? Who are you?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Vengeance? is my name? &mdash; why are you harassing me like this?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Certainly you can play the piano, but why would you want to make it so disgusting?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: I don&rsquo;t really have the time to explain this to you, and really you should educate yourself. This seems to be a bit anti-undead. [persuasion 16]</div>\n<div>The druids still look suspicious, but a little calmer.</div>\n<div>- Yeah, we&rsquo;ve been called that before, and I recognize how that could come off as bigotted. But we still ask that the undead clean up after themselves, the entrails and other body parts that fall off. Seomra has enough to deal with on her own.</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Let me give you this book, it&rsquo;s called human Fragility, and we don&rsquo;t realize the privileges that we have as humans &mdash; i&rsquo;m half-elf, so I can talk about this stuff. There&rsquo;s a workbook with some exercises you can do.</div>\n<div>- Is the workbook separate?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: no , that&rsquo;s something you can mail in for.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Cyrowan shuffles forward with the brochures he and Vengeance had made on their way north. One of the druids looks at it cursorily.</div>\n<div>- I think we&rsquo;re pretty good as far as educating ourselves goes. we have access to most of the knowledge in the known universe.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: It&rsquo;s this arrogance I&rsquo;m talking about . You need to know what you don&rsquo;t know before you know anything.</div>\n<div>- I&rsquo;m going to pity you and borrow your book.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: great, the answers come pre-filled in. other workbooks come blank, but mine are already filled in.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- So the answer key is there, you just want us to do the reading. there&rsquo;s no grading service?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: no, there is. there&rsquo;s &hellip; you send me some money and then I send you an A.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- And the cert is good for what?</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: It&rsquo;s really a self-betterment thing. the work that you do to earn the money to spend on the book.</div>\n<div>- Our money is basically this (she pulls out a leave with bones and a worm on it). it&rsquo;s primarily the leave, but sometimes we put a little spice on our currency. What&rsquo;s really dangerous is if you try to pull my hair out, without pulling it up.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick tries to &ldquo;read the room&rdquo; in order to see how much distraction is going on. And Vengeance has been employing Qi-Xotic Confusion. Flick&rsquo;s goal, getting Aphelia out of the room without being seen. So they are so engaged with Vengeance that they can&rsquo;t move or take actions. Vengeance takes out his three nut shells , &ldquo;Hey anybody want to play a quick game? It&rsquo;s really fun,&rdquo; yanking one of his teeth out and putting it under the shells. Instead of playing, they scream and pack gauze and phellem into his mouth. One of them is trying to get the gloves off his hands without touching them.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: Watch yourself!</div>\n<div>- Flick (whispers to Aphelia): Come with me now!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[Mick leaves]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Aphelia resists ineffectually, and with Eth distracted, Flick drags the personified Kiss backwards into the stairwell, promising inwardly to explain everything to her. The stairway begins to collapse on the two fleeing figures [insight 12], and pull back upwards, which seems intentional.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (to Aphelia): Have you ever &lsquo;gone between&rsquo; ?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick grabs her closely and does a dance spin to open the portal and catch both of them. [Arcana 8] . That doesn&rsquo;t work, so flick grabs her by the waist and dives off the stairway , using her climbing glove to hang onto the end and jerk a vine free that will swing them down to the ground. It goes so well that Flick is even able to manage a flavor-triple-spin and land lightly and gracefully on her feet with Amalia in her off-arm. A few leaves scatter picturesquely.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (whispering): I&rsquo;m really sorry!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Aphelia&rsquo;s nausea appears to worsen. Flick grabs her and pulls her towards the entrance. As they run past some other elves in there , as she made quite an entrance, she sees that Seomra&rsquo;s door is beginning to close. The doors close before Flick can get there and takes some bludgeoning damage.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: The biggest wound is to my pride!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Get off of her! (five other elves that have gathered around)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Upstairs, Eth sees that Aphelia has gone missing. She looks at Jean-Luc, and beneath her the floor opens up and she drops down a slide made of leaves to the floor below. Jean-luc hurries down the stairs.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: I&rsquo;m very dangerous! But against five, we&rsquo;ll see!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[DM tries to figure out the map system]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The elves are not wielding weapons.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (in elvish): Brothers and sisters, I&rsquo;m glad you can bear witness to the way I saved this young woman from the staircase malfunction. I know you&rsquo;re very impressed by that. We were going to go on a walk by the Alldrink; if you could back away we&rsquo;d very much appreciate it. Flick, addressing the elf who called back her unsuspecting companion, Ephlalphl, who (he) has his name embroidered on his leaf toga.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Efphalphl: the tree can clearly see that you&rsquo;re attempting to make your egress with no good business at hand; you&rsquo;ve taken this young lady here hostage?</div>\n<div>- Flick: Why would you trust its judgment more than mire?</div>\n<div>- The tree has an ability to read intentions; how else could it open paths for you</div>\n<div>- Flick: but surely it doesn&rsquo;t have access to the objective rightness or wrongness of any course of action. . why would you defer to it blindly?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Efphalphl: Well, you know, it _might_, as a possibly immortal vegetal entity. so who knows how close its connection is to true and false. but in any case it can see that one who&rsquo;s lived here her whole life seems to be in danger.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: I assure you she&rsquo;s in no danger. i don&rsquo;t know if you noticed, but i saved her &hellip; very impressively I might add.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Ef: is that where you decided to jump off the stairs?</div>\n<div>- Flick: we were both being prevented from using a slightly less convenient door. I see you&rsquo;re not going to be any help!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Dlapholph here! you want me to tell my friends what to do? I feel like that&rsquo;s commanding another.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Ok, i&rsquo;m just going to turn around and find the handle that&rsquo;s on this door and be on my way.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick [Intimidation 17] notices that Aphelia is clinging closer to Flick just because of Flick&rsquo;s proximity and her confusion. Flick again commits herself to explaining all this to Aphelia later. She glances behind her to see that there are two side entrances which opened when the primary door closed. Flick thinks it would be great if the elves started arguing amongst each other over who has the most authority. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re no better than the tyrants we oppose if we detain her,&rdquo; Flick, in self-righteous haste, imagines she hears. Aphelia gestures at her hands and Flick sees that her dulcimer is no longer there. Flick gives her the flute to play.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[Initiative is rolled.]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: You have exactly six seconds to let me leave or shit is going to get ugly. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend that you have any right to keep me here. [Intimidation 16].&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Two of the elves back off and join Dalpholf. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a point, I&rsquo;m going to let Seomra deal with it.&rdquo; But two others remain committed to keeping the sketchy Flick from leaving.&nbsp;</div>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-cd299809-7fff-d32a-fb85-45573f094c1d\"></span></p>"}

That's only in part due to the ecology of the world, but also how harsh that particular planet it. I've wondered if it was designed to be that hard to weed out specimens. I haven't achieved the final metamorphosis of brain elder yet, so &hellip; i'm going to leave the contemplation to then. You can really only understand the true name of elder brains by having cosmic background radiation converted into sound waves. i don't have the acoustic equipment . i have this sweet recording studio on Si'a. If you come, I'd love to show you some of this stuff. Just noodle around.</p>\n<!-- -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- -->"}

Flick was alerted with her morning coffee; once she'd laid a few coppers on the table the innkeeper \"remembered\" receiving a message from a messenger owl.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Ian and DK roll for gems in the satchels they got from the burrowlings.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav is always looking to improve her general wizardry and also dwarven history.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The library is related to the Bloodsledge Clan; the Archives of Ten-Axe of Bloodsledge.</div>\n<div>Dwarves love latinate puns.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Most of the population of Meliansein is Bloodsledge dwarves; the archives there are carved into the sandstone hills.</div>\n<div><hr /></div>\n<div>Flick pulls the letter from Drav out of her pocket and reminds the team that they have to meet up with Drav at the Archives. It's still early afternoon.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance has been tossing his hawkhatchet up in the air and catching it as he's been walking, an action which has improved his Dexterity. Vengeance only failed to catch it once, taking [1] point of slicing damage in one of his toes, which is what's leaving the trail of bloody footprints. This cut off a toe, which evened out his feet (the other foot was already missing a toe) is what improved his Dexterity.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick is eager to see Drav, feeling like she's been gone for a month.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav had left early in the morning after sending the message and luckily made it without molestation. She made it to town mid-morning. She came in on the southern roads, passing by some spooky woods to her left. They were darker and gloomier than to be expected of woods on the outskirts of a town. [Arcana 12] She feels a slight tingly in the wood, maybe some arcane flickerings, a little different from the mundane, but doesn't make the hair stand up on her neck. It's still morning, the bay to her brights is clear blue water; there's a lot fo ship activity on the ports. She heads north past the market square and sees what's his face selling fish and shrimp who gives her ooglie eyes; she casts her gaze ahead towards Meliansein.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Historically, the community here was chosen because the dwarves hewed close to the sandstone hills forming the banks of the river. The hills prevent floodplains from forming when the mountain thaw causes the river to swell. However, there are wild and tangled coves carved into the sandstone under the level of the ground near the river delta.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>It is established that the culture of the littoral is Amish on the top, Gangster on the bottom.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This town, Sandford, may have the problem of wild Rumspringas too.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>There are other dwarves throughout the town, but they are concentrated here.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Archives of Ten-Axe Bloodsledge</h2>\n<div>Drav arrives at the Archives. The space resembles one of the great halls when there were huge dwarven empires that spanned entire mountain ranges. There are delicately thin pillars which appear to hold up the cave ceiling, which allow her to pass into a completely silent space into an almost boxy reception room. There is a servitor at the entrance, introducing themselves as one of the heirs of the Bloodsledge family, taking Drav's dwarven credentials as a matter of fact. They show Drav to the stacks, and let her know of the museum component with used objects, some of which are paeans to Ten-Axe, and some which represent life in those days.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- \"Other dwarven clans may have led you to expect something more bureaucratic, but here we believe in the innate equality of individuals without requiring them to prove themselves before a faceless maze of paperwork and credentialism. Are you interested in the library or the museum?\" and they wait expectantly.</div>\n<div>- Drav: I think the museum side.</div>\n<div>- The servitor looks around. \"It seems we're in for a noontime rush\" (even the sound of the dripping water has completely ceased) \"but perhaps for some consideration I could offer you a tour\" He leans over at the hip obsequiously.</div>\n<div>- Drav: Very generous of you.</div>\n<div>- Servitor: \"Very generous of you too!\" he waits expectantly.</div>\n<div>- Drav offers a coin.</div>\n<div>- \"Yes there are tours to accommodate this degree of magnanimity.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>He walks Drav into a large hemicylindrical cave, on the sides are engraved gigantic statues. Ten-Axe is depicted in various heroic positions: slaying a dragon?, saving children? baking pig? only Ten-Axe is depicted, so Drav is left to imagine the other figures. The ancient ruler's strength, wisdom, and charisma is intended to be conveyed through these images.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Meanwhile the servitor has retreated from the space and disappeared. A lot of the artefacts bear placards, so his presence isn't entirely necessary. [Investigation 25]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Growing up with elven parents, Drav didn't get much exposure to Dwarven history or masonry (for which she feels a definite desidiria).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Under a sculpture of Ten-Axe carving his way deep under the heart of a mountain (wielding a sledgehammer in one hand and a pick in the other), Drav detects examples carved into the nearby sandstone illustrating some of the old styles of masonry: some for reinforcing caves, on one is an incantation which would allow her to strengthen an area of rock. And some more artistic designs throughout the periods of history Ten-Axe flourished. There's some history provided as well. (DM describes the original Moraddin's Crown, with a desert to the west.)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>Thousands of years ago, when the Strictland was rules by a single Dwarven empire, Ten-Axe held this montane range as a bulwark against the spread of the Great Desert and the peoples thereof. His familiarity and expertise with stone, and his ability to merge with it, allowed him to fend off the Desert.</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance sent a message to Drav in return for her message, \"If you happen to go to any museums, please see if there are any spellbooks which allow you to open portals to the dwarven astral plane.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Had Drav received the message before she departed, she likely would have had no idea what a dwarven astral plane was -- although on deeper consideration may have taken Venny to be referring to the prismatic powers of Eldar.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The hieroglyphics also depict how the Bloodforge clan used to be one with the Bloodsledge clan, but the Forge was awarded Moraddin's favor, and split off, which is why today they crowd around the \"new\" Moraddin's crown at the north of the Nephil Mountains.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav grabs a couple pamphlets</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&lt;!-- clearly has to be from the Sextet of Sextants; Devodee'anar isn't even introduced until the fifth quadrology</div>\n<div>- by historical quirk, every shitty series has to be a tetrology in the marshbout world. so there are plenty of franchises where you don't need that fourth book, -- half the time it's a prequel. how many times do i really have to hear about how Devodee'anar ran afoul of the ash maidens. stop rewriting it!</div>\n<div>- we get it, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, give us a new rhyme.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- \"although i heard the new tetrology is about Delphine, who has a lot of public support behind her. -- it really depends on who they get to write her. -- they don't credit any of their ghost writers. they're all credited to an A. B. McSchwartzman, and the ghost writers are all literal ghosts.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>all the printing presses are literally possessed, and do it all themselves -- they are awakened printing presses. that's how they pump the stories out so fast.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>in fact, one of the machines the gnomes came to melford to improve was one of their ghost-run printing presses. --&gt;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick et al approach the desk , the sound of water trickling.</div>\n<div>flick: is there something wrong with the plumbing?</div>\n<div>servitor: no, this is an archives, which can have whichever plumbing they wish</div>\n<div>flick: did a dwarf named drav come by?</div>\n<div>servitor: i wouldn't presume to a level of familiarity which would allow me to speculate on the identify of an acquaintance of yours.</div>\n<div>flick: oh one of these guys. she looks for a posted policy.</div>\n<div>servitor: you know my doctor told me recently that palpating fine metals can act as an aide memoir in recollecting names and faces</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Venny attempts to sneak past the servitor by dropping to his knees and adorning himself with a \"hat basket\" which he'd fashioned out of some reeds growing alongside the Strigge River. So enamored with Flick's jewelry is the servitor that he completely misses an utterly conspicuous Venny staking past him holding one or two branches. it is actuallly possible, if the servitor were not eyeing the jewelry, that he is blind.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick: good sir archivist, i'm actually looiking or something</div>\n<div>servitor: well believe it or not i'm also the head librarian</div>\n<div>flick: i'm actually looking for something written by a dr. sanctfeld imst and his *mental perturbations*. i've heard that he distilled that work out of some fieldwork he did in the south and tropical regions.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>of course the infamous psycholologist and herbabologist. these materials here are restricted to those pertaining to Ten-Axe of the bloodsledge clan, and his heirs and etc. and any historical events which may or may not have causative influence to those peoples</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick: surely you must know that Ten-Axe contributed materially to the Imst expedition of 1685, and surely you have some kind of miscellany pertaining to that.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav can barely hear anything because of the amazing study acoustics, except for the persistent dripping sound. Meanwhile, Flick's efforts are rebuffed. \"Don't try to put one past me, Elf, I know that Ten-Axe never headed south of the Aldran region, and in fact would have experienced great difficulty living there giving his mountainous constituion.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: Ok, well -- I'm here to meet my friend, and I will wait here. By all maeans, our benches are very comfortable by all accounts. Flick doesn't sit on the benches that aren't there.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav returns to a cart her copy of <em>Inveterate Worm Rocks and the History of Insecure Foundations in the Blood Mountains</em> and heads out to the foyer. She immediately notices the air of churlishness and petulance radiating from Flick just as the figure of Vengeance, crawling on knees and draped with vinery, pushes past her. The handsome, golden image of Jean-Luc, backlit by the very incredibly tiny distant square provided by the long long corridor. His flowing locks glow ever so slightly. Frosted tips, just like the Frosted Orcs in the north are known to wear.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance: Hey Drav. Fancy meeting you here. Psst, it's me, Vengeauns, im in disguise. Don't worry, i'm also going to disguise my voice just to be safe.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav: Uh oh, hey guys, what's going on.</div>\n<div>Flick: Drav! It's been too long. She pops up and gives her a hug. I think we should be on our way.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Did you find the facilities satisfactory? the servitor asks Drav.</div>\n<div>Drav: very much so, although I sense a little tension between . we'll be on our way now.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>the servitor gives her <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">a beard comb carved out of rockbone</span>,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> a hard white rock, wrapped in a little velvet comb case. and some beard oil contained within a slim glass vial sealed with red wax stamped with the full name of the archives.</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav: Uhhhh, thank you, and she stowes them in her satchel.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Secret Thieves Meeting Scavenger Hunt</strong></span></h3>\n<div>Twilight approaches.</div>\n<div>JL: i think it's safe to assume this is not an ambush, i think we should go in and \"you should behave yourselves\" (staring at Vengeance). i'll be honest, I have no idea what they want with me other than our mutual enemy.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: yes, i agree with JL, could you all for once try to keep a low profile.</div>\n<div>JL: We'll try to avoid fighting our way out of hear.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL goes up to the house and quietly knocks on the door. Flick is 10 feet behind. A few moments go by and an old woman answers the door. She's waring a lace bonnet and muslin pyjamas. \"Yes\"</div>\n<div>JL shows her the dagger.</div>\n<div>Oh take anything you want! Mervin, don't resist! There's burglars here!</div>\n<div>JL: i think you might have misread my intentions.</div>\n<div>Flick: Are we at the right house?</div>\n<div>JL: I'm not sure -- double-checks the map.</div>\n<div>Vengeance pushes his head in, a basket women on his head. \"I think you know what we're here for.\"</div>\n<div>Im' sorry I don't know what this is? You wish to see the basement and you won't hurt us? Go take a look.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL has had weirded starts to a meeting than this. He walks to the basement, and Vengeance subly tips over knick-knacks.</div>\n<div>Please my baskethead be careful! those are precious heirlooms!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: They look like chochkeys to me</div>\n<div>There's no need to be insulting as well as criminal.</div>\n<div>Flick: We're not here to take anything, mam. we were told to be at this address at this time.</div>\n<div>I don't know who could ahve told you that.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The basement looks like a root cellar, there are dried goods, pickled goods, root vegetables, wine, bread</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL, coming back up the stairs, and above the door frame he notices something etched above the door. Looking closer, he sees in a thieves' cant longhand it says \"have you tried reflecting on the address again?\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: fuck me, and pulls out a hand mirror that's part of her cosmetics kit.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: bullshit cryptography. JL, reading teh map, looks at it in a reflection. Flick is so used to honing the points of her arrow heads, she thinks --- it's weird that the market square in the middle is outlined in a darker color, esp with the sharp corners, she remembers that the corners of the square were softer. they try folding the map along one axis, which creates another blue dot in a different location</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: our apologies, mam</div>\n<div>oh, thank you, would you mind picking up the items</div>\n<div>flick: for your troubles mam (and holds out a gemstone)</div>\n<div>are you trying to get me murdered, i haven't held that much money in my entire life</div>\n<div>flick holds out two silver jots</div>\n<div>oh so generous! no, jk,</div>\n<div>vengeanec knocks over a callico critter.</div>\n<div>that was the last one in the collection! maybe I will take the gemstone.</div>\n<div>vengeance: i've collected from people like this before, I know how this works.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They make their way over to the other dot, which is in an area that's more spacious houses, but off the beaten path of the estates that oversee the market road into town. some have garden plots. because of the reflection, it could be one of two houses. JL gets into the area, and looks at Vengeance, he's' a weird dude, but sometimes he's more intuitive than you might give him credit for. he's not feeling particular antagonism towards either one; you think because of that, neither one of tehse is it, and maybe you've taken the wrong tack</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL keeps looking for some theives' cant. there's something he acn't parse, maybe it's Sandford specific, but if he could get someone who knows languages. He gives Flick a quick lesson on structure of thieve's cant. Nouns and verbs are vertical placement of symbols (higher is more active than lower)</div>\n<div>Flick knows that abyssal is spatially pictographic in a similar way. She asks Drav if she knows \"Comprehend Languages\". Because I don't know what the fuck these hobo scribblings mean at all.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>So Drav reaches out an touches thieves' cant written on a refuse bin that was clearly put out the night before, part of some endurance test you're being put through. \"Sharp metal also reflects\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeane takes out his bagpipes. \"I think I know what to do here, everybody\" He plays heavy metal, but slightly sharp. (the song) . (about when you have too much armor on) . Vengeance learned the song from reading -- and then imagining an interpretation.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick asks for a Dagger from JL. She holds it up to the thieves' cant so it's reflected along the horizontal axis, and asks Drav what that means. Drav touches the bin and the dagger.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: we're supposed to deduce a new point on the map.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL notices that the point of the dagger was at the strong point of the market square. They line the dagger point to point with the market square corner. It's fashioned such that the point is reflected back to the north, and if you look closely they see that the map has very faint circular markings around the spot.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: seems a little showboaty of them</div>\n<div>Flick: when you're the hat baskets, you have to prove you're hard in some other way.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They head over to that new point. The streets seem quiet. teh group is headed there just walking like normal, a bit hurried, at a brisk pace.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance is playing bagpipes. An arrow thunks into the wood inches from JL's nose, a note wrapped around the arrow.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick immediately runs to put her back up against a building on the side of the street she's closest to, and nocks an arrow. They are surrounded by three-story buildings, and she can't detect anyting. JL motions for Flick to put her bow down. JL looks at the note and sees a picture of a wanted poster. The issuer -- it looks like an underground source. signed by Yolindar, 10,000 gp. JL: it's rather flattering, and I didn't think I caused so much trouble.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>flick: what did you do, sleep with their spouse?</div>\n<div>Yolindar: lady</div>\n<div>JL: bisexual</div>\n<div>JL and Yolindar were never involved, canon.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL, on my last job I may or may not have foiled a kidnapping plot, although I don't think it was for 10,000 dollars so this may be an overreaction on their part. (he realizes they may have realizes after he absconded how much it would have been possible to get, or it led to other operations of theirs being compromised. )</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: they already told me that Yolindar put a bounty on me. He turns it over, and there are stick figures of you, one of Vengeance playing bagpipes with large musical notes, noise lines from their steps, people in windows looking at them, to convey conspicuity.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: this may be a friendly warning to step quietly.</div>\n<div>Flick: can we have vengeance stop playing Heavy Metal.</div>\n<div>JL: it's fair, I get it. we may want to retire for the night and have them contact us.</div>\n<div>Flick: we don't get to have our secret meeting?</div>\n<div>JK: I think it's poor ettiquette. there's a lot of ceremony, and it's been a while for me.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[insight nat 20] something about the letter, it's written in Rosindra's hand, and you think, oh, i might have failed this part, but it's still some kind of test.</div>\n<div>vengeance: as much as i love this font, JL, i wonder if this is a good idea. what do we have to gain? it seems like these people are giving us the runn around. what are we doing this for?</div>\n<div>JL: they want tot meet, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend. \\</div>\n<div>vengeance: they don't seem like good friends if they're treating us this way</div>\n<div>jl: they don't want us dead, and they could easily profit from my death</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick goes \"stealth mode\" , as does Vengeance, whose only change is to play a little quieter. And JL walks less conspicuously?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>They arrive at the last destination. It abuts another market square which probably greetes people coming in from the north. It's a residence that sits on the edge of the square. There's a building that has rounded edges, and one of the edges is a moat with a fountain, next to which hounses were built at some point. as they approach, there's a town constable or warden arguing with a man with an overturned cart, and someone who looks like as aspiring noble wearing armor, and the constable is trying to mediate between them, and they're incidentally blocking the entrance.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The argument is that the wagoneer is saying that the knight ran into him, and the knight is saying the wagoneer got in his way. and the wagoneer wants damages paid, and the knight wants a formal indication of his superiority.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance: OMG, you guys, wouldn't it be cool if these turned out to be the thieves, like Jean-Par Mezhan. This could definitely be the case, thinks the group. Flick attends more to the conversation. It does seem like they just started this argument and might be playing for time. Yet just because it's fake doesn't mean it's not a test.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL tests the sight-lines of the area we are in. Logically, what are the odds that this would have happened? There is a T-intersection, but the ground came up the handle, so they would have had to have seen each other. JL quietly approaches and subtly points this out.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Kindof interesting that you managed to crash into each other. Surely a knigth should be a better rider than to run into a wagon seen from hundreds of feet away.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[Persuasion bad] They look at JL like he's crazy . the knight maintains that the wagoneer is so drunk it was impossible to avoid him, and teh wagoneer that he's a teetotaller and that his father died from drinking, and his grandfather, and his great-great-grandmother , but not his great-grandmother.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: I know it's none of our business, because i'm not part of the constabulary, but if we all put our hats into this basket we can work it all out.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>constable turns to flick with a sly wink. Flick had pitched her voice to make it sound like an idiom. It's clear that the constable gets what she's saying.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\"The one must reflect before sticking one's hand in lest one find a pointy edge.\" assays Flick.</div>\n<div>Constable: You have some dangerous baskets you must deal in. Are you really sure you wnt us ALL to stick our hands in this dangerous basket together?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: I have enough basket cases -- I'm travelling with enough.</div>\n<div>Constable: it looks like some basket cases you didn't intend might have glommed onto your trail.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick and JL look behind themselves to see Rosindra waving to them from a doorway. She's holding a bow.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick: We'll leave you to workout this business, good KNIGHT.</div>\n<div>Constable: Do you intend to make your entrance to this place.</div>\n<div>JL: Sometimes you have to choose several hats since you don't know which ones you're going to need.</div>\n<div>Constable: it looks like you'll wear them even if they are soggy an falling apart</div>\n<div>JL: the best disguises are teh most inconspicuous ones. [and he does a hat-tip gesture to Rosindra]</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The \"noble\" canters off and the wagoneer with the constable's help gets the wagon straighteneed out. Vengeance tries to swipe something from the back of the wagon. Flick tries to interpose herself and grab his wrist.</div>\n<div>Vengeance : Flick , we need to prove that we're thieves so they will accept us.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The wagon was carrying low value vegetables in a great deal of bunting. So, vengeance reaches out for a (particularlly succulent) single cabbage in a box of hay.</div>\n<div>JL and DK try to dissuade vengeance.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vengeance: wouldn't stealing something of such low value show that we're true KLEPTOs.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick walks over to Rosindra, picking her nails in the doorway.</div>\n<div>F: SOrry to keep you waiting</div>\n<div>Rosindra: i'm not sure if this has been two failures or three... it helps me to understand where you land compared to other guild members.</div>\n<div>JL: I suppose we earned it</div>\n<div>F: were we supposed to deduce that we had to hold the dagger up to the map?</div>\n<div>R: it's ... it's a clue that others haven't failed to pick up on sooner. ?</div>\n<div>JL: it's been a while since i've been put through a cryptogram to find a meeting. forgive my rustiness.</div>\n<div>R: certainly understandable; this technique may be more common near the sandford area, and where metalworking is a high-status industry.</div>\n<div>V: he didn't want to steal the cabbage either, so clearly he doesn't get it like we do</div>\n<div>R: you didn't steal a cabbage? why, they were laid out for you to take! Let's consider that four failures</div>\n<div>Flick is way out of her depth.</div>\n<div>JL recognizes this as the sort of friendly hazing</div>\n<div>R :I'm more concerned that you aren't looking out for yourself enough. if anyone had seen these wanted posters across the city they'd have been able to identify you from across the city. i'm not even a good tracker as far as the hat baskets are concerned. true i did know where you were going. i could see you weren't trying to hide at all.</div>\n<div>JL: this is my first step in a city. I'm surprised that Yolindar's reach is this far, and that anyone tried to claim it.</div>\n<div>R: it's typically the cowards that try to claim it at first. you're right, we did shoot this poster before those who may have seen it as a bounty</div>\n<div>F: JL is thirsty</div>\n<div>R: did someone mention thirst traps? i hear they are big in the academy</div>\n<div>V: No</div>\n<div>F: JL goes after interesting company</div>\n<div>R: that's all part of the game.</div>\n<div>JL: you invited me here, so I assume you want to talk about the GM, or let us go on our way</div>\n<div>R: no, you're right, the meeting isn't set until a few minutes hence, at this location, if you'll all follow me.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>F: THIVES MEETING!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick heads to the building and realizes she does'nt really know where to go. she awkwardly pretends that that was the plan the whole time. rosindra beckons flick. by now it's almost entirely dark, the sun is setting. there's a little bit of fountain that still exists attached to the building. she sits on the fountain's edge and goes backwards holding her nose, but Rosindra disappears through the bottom.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick, no entirely sure what triggers the illusion, tries to go in as she did. she lands in a deep pool of water; above her is a gentle waterfall, and rosindra, a few feet ahead, swimming towards a dry area in an underground cave where others are standing.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick, using her gloves of climbing and swimming, outpaces her. she checks to see that her poison wasn't diluted or bow warped. she stored them well enough that they aren't. Pulling herself up onto the ledge there is a little stone bench with slots in it. Through the slots she can see a glowing , undulating shape. rosindra sits down on it and allows it to dry her clothes. flick follows suit.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>rosindra: we've managed to obtain<strong> a salamander, \"Nubbs\",</strong> which comes in handy ; here it dries off those who come through the fountain.</div>\n<div>flick: there must be easier ways to get into your own guild hall, or wherever this is. i mean, i'm all for a little cloak and dagger, but now you're just being twee.</div>\n<div>JL pops up out of the water. \"this is ... unnecessarily arduous\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>rosindra: we had to take special precautions tonight because many of our members were sure you wouldn't pass any of the tests and indeed i think only around half a test was passed, and the mebers who are the most conservative are confusingly th most twee and this is the only way they would agree to having the meeting with you.</div>\n<div>flick: that's fair enough.</div>\n<div>vengeance: i won't be needing your <strong>towel-mander</strong>. although i'd like one for my personal menagerie</div>\n<div><strong>rosindra: let me connect you with Sirzis</strong></div>\n<div>V: Sir Zeus?</div>\n<div>R: s-i-r-z-i-s. he's one of the leaders of a lizardfolk tribe. they breed and sell these salamanders.</div>\n<div>V: gotta catch'em all. sure, i'll take down his information</div>\n<div>flick: is that what they say?</div>\n<div>R: i've only heard: \"it's best to have just one\"</div>\n<div>v: i thought that was the point of this whole mission</div>\n<div>r: what mission?</div>\n<div>v: life</div>\n<div>r: so you're a creature hoarder?</div>\n<div>v: we prefer to be called connoisseurs</div>\n<div>r: i think you're describing a diletantte</div>\n<div>v: i like to have a lot of creatures around, and i think that makes a person a connoisseur</div>\n<div>r: what other creatures do you surround yourself with?</div>\n<div>v: well, these buffoons for one</div>\n<div>flick rolls her eyes</div>\n<div>r: so other ... humanoids?</div>\n<div>v: yeah, they are the most precious of all creatures</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Rosindra turns to JL, who's dried himself off by this point. \"We've completed tha tests. why the meeting? I find that most meetings can usually just ...\"</div>\n<div>R: this one is the result of some information we received and having done research into your and your companoins past, we did arrange for the wizard to learn about the archive so that she was in town when we brought you over. if you'd take a seat we can explain everything. a number of possible 'snaps' .</div>\n<div>flick: i might remind you, JL, that we do have promises to keep in the wider world.</div>\n<div>JL: my companion makes a good point. how many of these are time-sensitive.</div>\n<div>R: well, in one case, we suspect that the GMs will kill a number of people within the next day. the others aren't much longer, but fewer deaths, so one is quite dire.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: any opportunity to stick a fork in the eye of the gaol maidens, and i guess save some lives.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>there are some applecrate benches.</div>\n<div>Malenka stands up and introduces herself. she's a goblin or half-goblin, rather short, has crusty green skin and beyond her goblin provenance there's something a little mentally unstable about her. she's wearing all black; her hands and any exposed surfaces are covered in a thick white lime paste. she's not making eye contact with anyone in the room as she's talking. she furtively looks around the room</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Malenka: as you all know, i've been able to see by touching the corpse of Trovar after the Gaol Maidens killed her, it is clear that they took the log book, I can't quite see where it is. for those who don't know, the log book is connected to those of the captains who sail in, and deliver our shipments. once they know their destination port and time it appears in their log book and ours, and now .. now the gaol maidens have it. they can't read it yet, because it's under a secure, cryptographic, and tehy don't have they knowledge, ... it's clear they intend to kill as many as they can ... and other hints as to poisoning our supply or taking the contraband or more valuable objects.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Rosindra steps in. Vengeance, \"I think everything is very clear , we know what we need to do!\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>an eyeless, hairless siamese cat follows her and sits down next to her, as she and the cat are trying to divine from living creature's bones.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Rosindra, \"yes, what malenka has said is true, but the gaol maidens have acquired teh Log of Pathytus\" and they can tell where our shipments are coming in, and they aim to destroy, scupper, or steal as much as they can. we need that tome retrieved . since we don't know if it can be retrieved, we need volunteers to sail to captains and intercept them, and would like interventions at the coves, docks, or moorings, and stop anything at the last moment. as is usual, these operations are volunteered. they are our best ideas for stopping casualties, and if there are other suggestions we welcome them.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>one other has been to assail the GMs at their point of strength in the hope of providing enough of a distraction and killing or tying up enough of them so they can't carry out any raids.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: i like that last one. i don't think dancing around with ports, or trying to steal back the log book , will work. they are far from home, they can't be that strong from here.</div>\n<div>Rosindra: it's tru that they are far from home; the difficulty comes in if they are operating with splinter cells, but if they are autonomously operating cells, destroying the HQ may have no effect.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL:</div>\n<div>YOH-LAHN-DAR (Dk's pronunciation)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>[Insight 5] She is preoccupied by her religious meditations; she wouldn't necessarily actively persue a strategy of independent cells. She's fairly impetuous, though, so she may have authorized one and forgotten about it. \"she might have done that, but it seems worth taking that risk -- obviously I can't volunteer you all for th is mission, but, if we do we could get some sweet loot.</div>\n<div>vengeance: i'm kind of in favor of stealing a book. it's clean, it might not involve fighting. couldn't they just have made a copy of the book?</div>\n<div>malenka: the book is uncopiable. they can't read it, let alone copy it.</div>\n<div>JL: if they can't read it, how did they crack the code?</div>\n<blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Should have allowed insight check here for him to see if she was lying.</p>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n<div><strong>malenka</strong>: originally, they wouldn't have been able to reaed it. (she looks at drav) it's a wonder your friend made it down here safely. they've been kidnapping wizards on the road and trying to force them to crack our codes for quite some time.</div>\n<div><strong>flick</strong>: (having thought: that's what all this was for, to run errands for some randos?) kidnapping? really? so they are taking innocent people off the streets?</div>\n<div>malenka: they don't quite have the abilities to enslave them, but they do manage to make them work in one way or another. typically they don't have to resort to magic.</div>\n<div>flick: let's put it right back up their ass.</div>\n<div>JL: do we steal the book, or punch them in the mouth?</div>\n<div>vengeance: i vote book.</div>\n<div>drav: i don't like this kidnapping innocents off the street.</div>\n<div>flick: this would mean taking out the splinter cell--</div>\n<div>vengeance: if we get the book, drav can read it and we can intercept incoming cargo.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav and JL smell fumes of an incendiary device. vengeance can smell smoke coming from underneath his applebox. Flick smells smoke coming from somewhere, faintly. it could be the salamander. JL shouts \"bomb!\" and jumps into the pool.</div>\n<div>Flick doesn't know what \"grenade\" is,</div>\n<div>Drav can see a rectangular mass that has started to emit light in points.</div>\n<div>vengeance: drav you should try this, the smoke stings so good when you get your eye right up there.</div>\n<div>Drav wraps her hands around vengeance, pinning his arms to the side , and drags him into the pool.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL's warning alerts slightly fewer than half, who run and jump into the pool in time. Above them, the room fills with liquid fire . For flick, standing in the EP, the grey haze is gone, and a bright sun is shining on you (can't figure out from where) and Flick feels weak, weaker than she's ever felt, and she can still smell the smoke -- and she can't tell where it's coming from. within seconds, the roiling fire burns itself out. clouds of ash billow in the space.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JL: clearly they planted the bombs before we were involved, so this isn't our fault.</div>"}

A temporary truce is called, and on Scunner's thiefly word, and the gang's almost complete disavowel of the Hat Baskets, they are allowed further into the caves, where are situated a giant salamander, a lizardfolk shaman and about half a dozen similarly dressed humans. They appear to be engaged in mining a muted blue crystalline ore, but before the adventurers can enter, the oldest human, Fundi, runs over and prevents the group from entering the ritual mining space -- for such it is -- until they've passed a bevy of personal questions. The mining team deliver their own side of the \"stolen logbook\" story, which is that the Hat Baskets stole the giant salamander's baby mandling and they hoped for a hostage exchange by stealing the book, whose power Breg believes too great to leave in Hat Basket hands. The adventurers immediately back this new horse and plan to retrace their steps to recover \"Nubbs.\" Everyone gets drunk and goes to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h1 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>JL is surprised that Scunner isn't dead.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick makes a Perception check to judge the distance of the others down the tunnel. 15.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She thinks they are close enough to get there this round or next round if they dash. Flick, not wanting to be the first thing they see, moves and calls out to Jean-Luc, \"You're going to want to duck!\" and force-shoots Scunner.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>23 force damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scunner twists and puts the column between himself and the arrow, but it's clear he's in bad shape: JL's thrust to the armpit is bleeding copiously. Gerd flies on in ...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ian informs the team that summoning Gerd scales with spell level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... and mauls the rogue, but it's still too lumbering to hit him. Gerd's momentum carries it over to the other side, licking the salt crystals there for a moment before turning back to face the adversary.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Galen arrives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance admires the 'water feature,' a tasteful and well-appointed pond with a different species of fish inhabiting each step of the pool, arranged by color of the rainbow. Flick sees that the first person to round the corner is a dwarf, clad in thick woolen grey robes. She has a grey-white bears obscuring her face and a beretlike cap. She carries in her hands a staff carved out of a pure white crystal. As she casts&nbsp;Maximillian's Earthen Grasp, the rocky floor erupts into the shape of a hand which secures Jean-Luc in its grasp and squeezes tight. JL starts gasping for air. \"What ... the fuck...\"</p>\n<p>Vengeance recalls that the spell is named after Maximillian, a man who was killed by falling into an open mine, and then named for a chess move where one of the pieces goes forward a great number of spaces , sacrificing itself. As Vengeance communicates this history to JL he begins to lose consciousness.</p>\n<p>Flick bets dollars to donuts that this is a concentration spell.</p>\n<div>Breg: Parlay with us, or your friend is crushed. I know what you've come for -- it's the book you want, isn't it?</div>\n<div>JL: Parlay sounds good!</div>\n<div>Flick: Can we at least kill Scunner?</div>\n<div>Breg: No, Scunner's with me, as different as our ways of life are.</div>\n<div>Flick: It was worth a shot.</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance, intending to use his Quixotic Qonfusion ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... says, \"release our friend here and we will do anything you wish.\" Flick: We'll put down our weapons Vengeance: One wish Breg: You can cast the wish spell? Flick [undecipherable] Breg: What? you broke up there in the lava static. Vengeance: There's lava in here? Breg: Well, as a geomancer I'm in touch with all the rocks and uh, the lava is distant but it does contribute to my signal-to-noise ratio. Flick: I said i'm pretty adept at the misty step. that's impressed people in the past. Breg: But not a wish spell. Vengeance: Yes, by \"wish\" i basically meant that we would perform one dance for you, and it would be the misty step. Breg: How interesting. You've certainly made different overtures than other members of the Hat Baskets. Is it -- does this spell attempt to work some kind of charm over us? V: The Hat Baskets are really upping their game, as you probably know, and they've been hiring better and better actors, and so we're part of the latest crop. Breg: You really hit the nail on the head saying \"actors.\" They merely play-act at this game that the rest of us have been involved in our entire lives, for actual stakes. V: Is it a game to you? Breg: No! Are you saying you're a performer? V: No. Breg: Then why are you so interested in this dance? What's going on here?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Somehow Vengeance has gotten around to Confusing her, allowing him to make a good-faith Persuasion check. 18.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jean-Luc has been doing some kind of self-anti-boa constricting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Breg: We do appear to be at a standoff. Perhaps a dance would allow us to reset ourselves. Vengeance: Well, Flick, it's up to you, now.</p>\n<p>Flick tries her best to improvize \"Misty Step\" -- there were barn dances and such. She spent a fair amount of time moving rhythmically with other young people. Plus she's very light on her feet, and can make things look pretty good to someone standing 70 feet away. Flick, raised by humans foster parents. They weren't kind, but neither were they abusive and isolating. She can do a bastardized jig for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick gets to make the performance check with her Dexterity modifier.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Breg looks like she's getting into it; she's one of the stouter dwarves, and Flick is flitting around the column; she may be put in mind of tales of the elves and dwarves having huge shared feasts together. She turns back and shouts. \"It's ok, we've brokered a sort of truce here. I'm sure we can sort this out. You'll love what this elf is doing, by the way.\"</p>\n<p>Flick pauses to stare daggers at Vengeance, who's openly weeping at the beauty of the dance. Vengeance turns to Jean-Luc, \"Now I know why they call it the misty step.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DK points out Vengeance is not close enough, and JL is constrained by the giant rock hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL: Very nice, still stuck in an earthen grip here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scunner puts a hand up to his eye to wipe away a tear, which becomes an ice droplet and shatters on the ground. Breg lets the spell drop, and the hand crumbles back into the floor of the cave.</p>\n<p>JL: So we've agreed to a parlay, yes? Breg: Yes. If you wish to come back here, it's a little more hospitable, and we can talk about our mutual needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick and JL think that they really need to keep the Gaol Maidens from finding out who he is. However, he's not sure if these people know who he is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL Investigation&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The distance of Kriobolis from Marshbout is around 500 miles, so it's fairly unlikely they would have received information about a hit on you, since that's pretty specific and they are stationed here, and in fact if few people know they are here at all (!).</p>\n<p>JL flashes a hand signal to indicate that he comes in peace, and Scunner meets his eyes and shakily returns the hand signal; Breg doesn't appear to notice. Flick walks over and hands a goodberry to the Gaol Maiden</p>\n<p>Your mercy is as meaningful as your hostility, elf. What do I call you.</p>\n<p>Flick: My name is Flick. Scunner: The full name's Blad Schillaber, but everyone calls me Scunner. Blad has all those connotations these days. He eats the goodberry and looks quite full. \"I thought those roast meats had filled me up, but I guess I didn't all the corners. You're ohhhhhhhh,\" and he passes out. Gerd moves forward and begins to lick his wound. JL suggests to Vengeance that he tend to JL. Vengeance comes over and joins in the licking. It's clear Scunner hasn't had a fight like this in quite sometime. He wakes up to pontificate: \"I still don't know how I missed you with that first swipe. I mean, I know you're a fellow Maiden, but what kind of training have you had?\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: I imagine we come from the same school. You know how it is: you see a glint of steel and your instincts kick in. Scunner: You're right, I've probably been staring into the flames for too long. I'm not used to being underground. JL: Preaching to the quite. Scunner: Uh, huh. Sure. You don't happen to have any drink on you?</p>\n<p>JL offers him a swig from the Tepplin bottle.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would Flick have noticed the Thieves' cant hand signal? DM says no.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scunner sees the brewer's mark on the bottle. \"Ah, right on for you, did you steal this from some high-flying elites? Well done.\" JL: I don't know its provenance. I came across it under somewhat unusual circumstances which I'll have to relate later. Scunner: \"Well, you must know -- the Tepplin distilleries provide all the priests in Kriopolis with their sacramental wines and their religious drinks.\" It's clear that Scunner, with the loss of blood, the goodberry, being licked by Gerd and Vengeance, and a few shots of liquor have loosened his tongue. \"I hear that somebody's making a play for their Star. I think they want to brand beers for the common man with the Star so they can sell 'elite' drinks at higher prices.\" He goes on to criticize commodity branding and the sheeple that buy into it. JL: I miss the days when the lower classes brewed their own beer and had a good time doing it. Scunner: That's right! Brewing their own beer, leavening their own bread. Now they have to get it from whoever's ... JL: \"And the leases!\" He goes on a rant about the economy&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Persuasion check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's clear that JL's bourgeoisie education start creeping into the way he's talking about things. Scunner, \"Ok, I see eye to eye with you. As I've said, I'm Scunner\" JL: Jean-Luc.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DM establishes that, from the rolls, he doesn't know about a bounty on your head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scunner looks like the name reminds him of something. \"It's an odd name for Kriopolis ... maybe you're from southern Albland? I know a few Jean-Lucs from there\" Vengeance: He spells it J-A-A-A-N L-U-K-E like a fun unconventional spelling. Such were JL's parents, I guess.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL insight check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL detects that Scunner's eyes lit up when Jean-Luc said his name, and this business about other Jean-Lucs is clearly covering for something. He doesn't know about the bounty, but he's heard of you, or heard the name and now has a face. JL plays along, so Scunner doesn't know that JL knows that Scunner knows.</p>\n<p>Flick calls Gerd over, \"Flit over by that column and keep an eye on the Geomancer, and tell me what she does and says.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gerd is Gerd-sexual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gerd communicates to you that there are a bunch of people chilling back in the tunnel. It holds up most of its hands (each with 3 claws) to indicate the number of people. Flick wants to know if they are holding weapons. It holds up one claw, and puffs his cheek up, and mimes doing a really large creature. One claw. Then he mimes smoking. 3 claws.</p>\n<p>Flick: So it's either a really fat guy, or an ogre. and someone toking.</p>\n<p>Breg: I hope you've brought more to parlay with than just that dance, unless we have to recommence hostilities, but why not come back here?</p>\n<p>Flick: we need to be ready to act or think fast because we're not fooling anyone at this point. JL: \"Scunner's assured me of safe passage. Unless things go totally sideways\" and he looks over to Vengeance. JL helps Scunner to his feet. \"I can tell you're not like the Hat Baskets; one of them has aim like you wouldn't believe, but you seem much more grounded than whatever's going on with that group. I'm still curious. None of us want to die&nbsp;too&nbsp;prematurely.</p>\n<p>By the time they round the corner he's a little more steady on his feet. They see a few humans hanging out in the corner and smoking.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight checks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All except Jean-Luc recognize quickly that this is an extended family unit, unlike what those unfamiliar with thieves groups might have expected, which would have been individual ne'er-do-wells with secretive backgrounds. In addition, they see a very large creature, 12-15 feet long, looking like a scaled-up newt, emitting a yellowish-red light which they identify as the cove light. Next to the salamander is a lizardfolk who appears to be the creature's handler. The salamander is facing a heaping pile of ore, and near its butt a smaller pile of bright-blue cylindrical gems. The family looks like they were the ones mining.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav's 'wizard' part suddenly realizes this is a gemstone known as Azurite. It's a blue mineral which will slowly lose its vibrancy over time, and indeed there appears to be a kind of oily rectal mucus swaddling the crystals. Drav knows that it's used as a spell component for high-level spells that try to diminish the power of other things.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like Jorgensen's Blue Balls, Ian suggests. The DM clarifies that it's more likely to be The Inverse of Jorgensen's Blue Balls, which are being crushed by Maximillians' Eearthen Hand. There is a famous statue on the North Strictland of that exact thing, marking the entrance into the Val&ouml;r Pass. The 'balls' part of the statue is made of a stable blue mineral, rather than Azurite.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone looks pretty relaxed except for someone who looks like the grandfather; he's spry but has grey hair, and a tetrapod animated boulder which has skeletal arms and legs protruding from it.</p>\n<p>Fundi: Breg says you're hear to parlay, and not to interrupt our mining? JL: We have no reason to stop your mining. Not our bailiwick. Fundi: Well as you can see I've set up this periphery of ribbons; they&nbsp;area traditional part of the goings-on. I must ask you a few questions as you approach the area. Have any of your been infidelitous to your spouses or significant others? Flick: I'm not married. JL turns to the group: Are any of us married? Vengeance: Uh, yeah! But it would take me a few days to figure out how to answer that question truthfully. It depends on so many definitions. Fundi: Can you stay as far away from the mining, then? Since that's going to disrupt the blessing we're trying to impose on this area. Flick: Is azurite oxidized by perverts or something? Fundi: Well, yes, kindof. The ore gets corrupted and it's much more difficult to smelt -- and, furthermore, nasty effects can attend those who don't follow the proper ritual precautions that must be taken. Vengeance: Does it matter, sir, that my Wife happens to be a mule and is, in fact,&nbsp;not&nbsp;manogamous. Fundi: Is she here? With you? Vengeance: No. Fundi: Well ... I've already asked you to stay as far away as possible. But let me ask. Nyuka! I have a theological question for you! Nyuka, the lizardfolk handler of the salamander. \"Yes, what's your question.\" Fundi repeats what Vengeance has told him. Nyuka: No, as long as she stays far away it shouldn't have any effect. Fundi: Ok, then you may enter, but for a number of reasons, some of which are merely the general unpleasantness of being in close proximity to you, I ask that you keep your distance from the mining. Vengeance: Yes, that will do, thank you.</p>\n<p>Vengeance takes a look at some of these ribbons comprising the perimeter fence. Fundi says they are fabrics of some rarity, originating likely from the \"Acha Bashoor\" continent to the southwest.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>History or religion check to determine legitimacy of the pomp. Ian declines to roll, as Flick would not quibble with Fundi's explanations. Most roll a 10.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many practices that concern extracting rare earth materials do involve a great deal of magic and ritual. Depending on where you fall on the religion/spirituality spectrum, you might believe the necessity more or less. Depending on Drav's increasing contact with Eldar, she may develop more respect for it. But they may regard it as \"hooey\" even if they don't believe in it themselves, but you wouldn't tell someone not to go to church.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc knows that Acha Bashoor is south of Kriobolis, which is on the isthmus dividing Ys from Bashoor. There are beautiful textiles and port cities which export the same. Flick is only vaguely aware that there are even other landmasses. She's pretty provincial, but commits to play along with their ribbon-dance games. She is also romantically inexperienced, so finds Fundi's prodding somewhat offputting. Of course, a kiss and cuddle happened at the barn dances, but she watched most of her peers die. She outlived her foster parents while she was an \"adolescent\" -- she saw several generations of her environs live, marry, and die, while she looked the same. Other people know that she's not part of the dating pool.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The DM relates that the world does abide by plate techtonics where possible. But he does admit that the ecosystems don't make as much sense as they might. The DM also pictures Flick as Jack Nicholson showing up in time cycles at the Shining, returning to ask who's going to be at the next barn dance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick was found as an infant, is 75 now. Recently it occured to Ian that she outlived her foster parents and is late adolescent relative to elf life cycles, and a little damaged in being raised by faster-living humans. It can be a big or small a part of the campaign as desired. Her life in that town must have been pretty weird. Imagine a human raised by a series of their pets.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Breg approaches Drav; she's a fairly old Dwarf, probably 400 years old. All her hair is grey and white. Her face looks literally chiseled from rock, which appears to have infused the character of her face. Drav gets a vibe that she's pretty intuitive about this kind of stuff. \"I can tell that you've recently been dabbling in the ways in which dwarves can communicate with rocks and mold rocks to their will.\" Drav: That's absolutely correct. I didn't grow up with much exposure to that. My parents are elves, they loved me very much, but and I didn't learn much about this stonework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Breg: that's very interesting, and now you find yourself drawn to it. Have you found any expertise or instruction on your travels? Or doing your own research? Drav: I've done a lot of reading, but it's not the same as practicacl experience. We seem to get distracted by many things along our journey. Breg: If you were to practically engage, how would you envision doing so? Drav: The way you seem to be able to read the rock and stone, and mold and shape it, that's not something I've ever done myself, or seen done. Breg: What you've seen so far are almost parlor tricks of the geomancer. These are commonplace spells for magically inclined dwarves. I myself am too old to take on an apprentice, but there are areas in the world that would love to take on a dwarf of your inquisitive nature to learn of the living rock.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She scribbles down a small map of the area, and identifies some mountains to the east: there's a well renowned teacher here, her name is Obnovenie Sveta. she's unique in a number of ways, one of which is eschewing the traditional dwarven habit of taken a last name that's a noun compound; she said that the name was given to her by one of the earth elementals. I think you would be perfect precisely because of your knowledge of the written word. She teaches dwarves to learn the powers of the earth through runes that are inscribed into the rocks themselves, and it acts as a mediating, plastic medium for those who have the power within themselves but just need a channel through which to direct that power.</p>\n<p>But in the meantime I can certainly teach you the rudiments of the spell I was able to cast on your roguish friend. She takes Drav's hand, spits onto the wall behind her, rubs the stylus in the stone ink, and inscribes the text of the spell into her spellbook, holding drav's hand under hers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maximillian's Earthen Guuuuurrrrrrrrasp</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav hugs Breg, who hugs her back. They are both strong. In this instance Drav expresses deference to her elder, and Breg gives her a rib cracking hug, that feels warm, parental, strengthening, all in one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inspiration point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fundi gets up on the turnbuckle and presses down the ribbons and motions to everyone to come in. Breg turns to Flick, \"are you acting as an agent for the hat baskets. scunner seems to think you're not quite of their ilk.\"</p>\n<p>Flick, \"I didn't even know the hatpins from adama before i arrived here. the way i help friends is by shooting things, and I'm sorry we had to cross paths in that way. no hard feelings.\"</p>\n<p>Breg: you'd have to take that up with scunner -- we did post him as a guard. all things being equal, i'd say put it in the past</p>\n<p>Scunner: i think it was a fight well met and well returned. there are no hard feelings here. I've seen it go worse so many times. his lower lip starts to tremble as he stares into space. JL pours some fortifying liquor into his mouth.</p>\n<p>JL: we seem to have found ourselves in a dispute that we're not sure we're a part of. we have almost literally, and definitely figuratively, stumbled in here.</p>\n<p>Breg: so what was it that did bring you here?</p>\n<p>JL: you guys are a cell, outfit, or extension of the gaol maidens?</p>\n<p>Breg: The Ruhu family here would think of themselves as a self-contained family unit within the GM, i'm not sure if they see themselves as an extension. Fundi: We were able to claim this mining spot for ourselves, and that has to be honored by the GMs JL: So it's a franchise opportunity. Fundi: In a way. JL: I had some dealings with the GM back in Krobopolis, then we were approached by the Hat baskets who were trying to wind us up to send us after you because of whatever turf war you two are in. But we have no interest in either side of that dispute. Flick: There was the matter of the aethereal firebomb. JL: Yeah, was that you?</p>\n<p>Nyaka perks up. \"Did you say there was an explosion?\" Flick: A very strange one. (and, unguardedly, describes what it looked like from the aethereal plane.).&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight checks all around. Drav is still beaming after hugging Breg and notices nothing. Flick and JL do well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL notices -- he used to know the name of his city; the fact that he doesn't know how to pronounce it anymore is worrisome; something mystical might be going on. Flick notices something similar, a little ameliorated, but she hasn't seen anyone (except maybe when her original foster parents got dementia) thinks JL might be under a localized aphasia. She knows of a legend that Gonfalon told her, of a dark wood, when people would live within the shadow of the wood, they couldn't remember anything that had happened during that period of time. She's been noticing this since she's known JL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance: JL, why don't you just call it C-town, or the Big C. that's what I do with my monastery.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JL intelligence check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick does know of a Kriobolis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL can't remember if it's spelled with a K or a C.</p>\n<p>Flick hears \"kribopolis\" and asks to be excused by the dwarves, hops over the club ribbon, and walks to JL. Can you repeat after me: Kree-ah-bo-lis . JL repeats it fine, no problem. \"Sorry, dwarves, a bit of house keeping.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hate to get involved in this sort of thing, but, well, ...\" Flick: by all means, everyone's up in our shit. \"I'm gonna let Nyaka ask you about the explosive device while I pontificate\"</p>\n<p>Nyaka comes over: \"it sounds like ... describe to me more this explosion.\" Flick does her best. they smelled smoke and JL saw an ingot under vengeance's crate. \"I'm able to step into neighboring planes. it was a bright radiation in the ethereal plane.\" Nyaka: you may need to speak with the elves. I don't know what this is. Flick: mother -- you don't think i'm a vampire too, do you? Nyaka: no, elves. Lhaska keeps me warm no matter what the temperature; we have quite a bond between us. As a warmblood, you wouldn't understand. It also sounds like you weren't told that we were working a joint venture with the hat baskets to mine the iridium flick: that sounds expensive Nyaka: it is, a very rare metal. if we'd had our way, we would have been the only ones taking the ore. but the hatbaskets had managed to maneuver into a position of negotiation, and we were forced to split with them. flick: they didn't tell us about this. the explosion went off, -- no one died, but they were very hurt, and they immediately pointed us your way.</p>\n<p>Drav, at the time, noticed that the explosion was an iridium-like material. It's very rare on the crust of the planet. in order to find a vein is almost unheard of. (Iridium is completely resistant to rust.)</p>\n<p>Nyaka: i'm not the first to say this, but those naive idiots probably didn't know the danger of the material; all our sources tell us that they're trading with the Gormflaith in the Sea of Kosht.</p>\n<p>Fez had mentioned the Gormflaith as being on the Majestic Elf -- sea pirates that live in marshy areas, interested in iridium as it's rust resistant and an elite high-value material for weapons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nyaka: I don't know what would cause it to explode like&nbsp;that, though. was the ... mandling they took from us nearby it at the time? the salamander child? (-- the creature underneath the bench. the bench was close to vengeance's seat. (they recall that it was about 5 or 6 feet away). )</p>\n<p>Nyaka: it's possible that an immature mandling, unable to control its heat, could have caused an explosion, but i think something else could have been going on. but in any case, you say that they do still have the lizard child</p>\n<p>vengenace: the lizard child!</p>\n<p>nyaka: i don't know why the hatbaskets are so vicious, but they stole lhaska's baby and refused to give it back, and we had no choice but to take the log book. JL: do you think they'll make that trade? Nyaka: they haven't shown any indication so far. Vengeance: Nyackha! Nyaka: You pronounced my name in the ancient way! Vengeance: No i had a great joke. Nyaka: ok, go ahead Vengeance: I was going to compare our \"common beef\" to the handsome jean-luc, who is a peasant, and thus also, \"common beef\" Nyaka: Very good&nbsp;</p>\n<p>behind Lhaska , there is a spit on which an entire roasting sheet is rotating, and from which parts have been eaten.</p>\n<p>Fundi has some markings on his face that look like they could have been blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance: well now i'm really distracted: is that sheep for your salamander? Nyaka: you really don't know what the salamander eats? V: nnnnnnnoo Nyaka: we feed it the ore, and inside its body, it performs the smelting, and excretes the pur mineral, the azurite. V: that's the way my favorite coffee is made. well i was going to offer a trade. perhaps we could kill a few hat baskets, and in exchange we can take this fine lizard. Nyaka: we've refrained from killing as much as possible. they're just annoying rich people; if we could have made this ransom exchange it would have been the preferred outcome. and also, i would never give up Lhaska. we are almost as Lovers, in your hot blooded terms. V: everything must have its price Nyaka: no, that seems like a capitalist perspective. here we're largely family or clan or lineage-based system of thief traders V: i would sell my wife for fifty ... dubloons?</p>\n<p>Breg: Is that because you've been infidelitous? Out of the ribbon area. GET. HIM. OUT.</p>\n<p>Fundi approaches Vengeance adn Scunner bats him back. V: Not you too, scunner Scunner. i gotta listen to Breg, man. She can literally make the rocks swallow me.</p>\n<p>JL: the HB stole your salamander, you stole their logbook, they're unwilling to make the trade, do we know what they want with your salamander?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nyaka: as you can see, salamanders are capable of almost elemental feats with minerals. I expect that's their intention. Breg: what Nyaka told you is not the whole truth. we took their logbook because it's of a magnitude of power far beyond what they can control, for quite petty reasons, so they know when their captains arrive in port. they don't even know that the corresponding logs the captains possess will corrupt them over time, and that this log can't be controlled but rather is something which controls you over time. i think -- we are not willing to give it back to them, i must admit, even if they did want to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: i remember why i left the theives' guild now. all these internal squabbles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Breg: we would like to think we're on the right side of things JL: it's what everybody thinks Breg: I guess you have a point. JL: why do you think the log book is corrupting them?</p>\n<p>Breg: it's because they've portrayed it to you as just a log book. the magician who originally created it, pathytus, he was a magician ... from beyond the stars, and his magic when applied here, could only do harm to the consciousnesses native to this planet, and the areas from where he came, the consciousnesses were merged into a single field , undifferentiatable, and i believe that this logbook, were it allowed to propagate its influence, would bring about the same on this planet. creating a sort of horde or swarm of ethically divested intellect.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>is this bullshit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>vengeance remembers training at the monastery, reading a text that concerned the synchronization of the rotation of the celestial sphers. he rememberes that the sphere in which this planet is inscribed was believed to intersect with the other sphere every thousand years, intersecting twice once every thousand years looking like bike spokes -- this other sphere was thought to be inhabited by the kind of collective intelligence that the geomancer is describing.</p>\n<p>vengeance: yeah, it's just a mcguffin guys flick has read enough of the demerast saga that she knows what a mcguffin is.</p>\n<p>flick: if the whole point is to get this from point a to point b, should we take it, or can we ask nicely?&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight check from JL for battle intelligence on their odds in this fight</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance: but, if we want a salamander, assuming the child has the same properties as this one, we need only go back to the hat baskets, and steal from them because they are clearly incompetent; so I say we go and steal that lizard. we definitely want to steal the lizard, right?</p>\n<p>JL: Seems worth asking: are we sure we want to be involved in this conflict? We do have those gnolls to save. And I was only investigating this to see if we're connected. If Yolandar does have a price on my head, it hasn't reached marshbout yet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>JL: How dangerous is it if the hat baskets have the baby salamander? What level of malfeasance are we talking about? (he asks...) Nyaka: How dangerous is it if the hatbaskets have your child? JL: In the grand scheme of things, I'd be devastated. Nyaka yes, it's devastating; emotionally and psychologically it takes quite a toll. we will have to ... make a run to free it, i believe, soon. Flick: so that salamander that was drying our asses, that belongs to these people? well then we have to help them. these guys stole this log book, but that's a living creature that has to stare at people's assess all day. we're not going to let that happen, right? Drav: I agree with flick. JL: let's go make another enemy. Flick: i have plenty of notches ... left? on my belt? for enemies. Nyuka: You'll help? Flick: we're going to get back your -- JL: -- don't give them guarantees! Nyuka: well in that case, why don't you join us in the feast. We have to eat this entire sheep before we can proceed with the mining. As long as none of you are infidelitous. JL: what if you've caused&nbsp;others&nbsp;to be infidelitous? Breg: What do you mean exactly? JL: So, I'm not married, but I've had several affairs with married men and women. Breg: And none of them believed it to be exclusive? JL: No...? You know how it is. Breg: An interesting blind spot in this practice. We must convene.</p>\n<p>Breg, Nyaka, and Fundi come over and knock heads. They talk for a few moments. They all look very happy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is even better than we thought! It explodes our conceptual notions of what constitutes fidelity, obligation, and responsibility. Even your weird half-elf friend is welcome into the circle.</p>\n<p>Flick: Wow, let's have some roast.</p>\n<p>JL intuits that they might have gotten things wrong here, and it might affect the success of this operation and the future luck of anyone who participates.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does he know that?&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL motions to Fundi: when was the last time the original text was reviewed? Fundi: Well this is a tradition that's been passed down orally over generations, so I wouldn't say there's an original text. It largely involves getting involved with our family spirit Ruhu, which may have been mentioned before. JL: and when was that? Fundi: when we sacrificed the sheep, that was to Ruhu, and we spread the blood over our faces, and eating the sheep, in order to placate Ruhu with the magnitude of the ceremony.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vengeance has a daydream where his face is smeared with blood and he's eating a leg of mutton? \"Come over here and let me shotgun you some meat.\" He takes JL's head in his hands in order to -- he jolts alert.</p>\n<p>JL thinks that they are so excited by what's going on, that they are overlooking any ritual specifics. Since he doesn't believe in the metaphysical nature of this anyway, (like someone misreading a starchart of astrology) he doesn't care and starts to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They bring out roasted flatbreads and beer; they ask you to pass around the Starr liquor. They fill their bellies and no man lacked his share of the feast. the annoying younger brother Haigi says that, and JL thinks to himself: did this idiot also have to study heroic poems? are they still teaching that?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Charisma check.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fundi approaches V. \"You know, i could tell you wanted this little boomerang to return to your hand\" and goes to grab at V's crotch. \"I'm afraid that one won't come back to you.\" - \"But, I expose myself; there's -- when I was growing up, one of my schoolmates went on to become an artificer, he went on to infuse weapons with spells. There's a spell which I believe is called ... I'm sure an artificer would be able to tell you. it allows your weapon to return to your hand, with just the action of the mind. If you were able to find an artificer with this spell you could ahve the weapon you desire.\" - Vengeance: \"i'll just write down my address for you.\"</p>\n<p>Flick: Peglini's Plenty Persuasive Plea to Return.</p>\n<p>\"Look it's returning weapon, yes.\" - Vengeance: Flick, you knew all along? I'm going to kill you.</p>\n<p>Fundi sits back to watch drama: oh is there a disagreement between you two, oh yes? Vengeance: who even are you? Fundi: I'm just an old man who knows his rocks, who knows how to get his rocks off. Flick: We sure can pick 'em guys. V: I guess he's a part of the group now.</p>\n<p>Nyaka comes over to JL; she's also affected by the beer. She and Lhaska have been swooning on each other; she's high on passion and drink. Nyaka: As a lover, I can see that you hold two items that wish they were more united than they are now. (and she points to his daggers). I have the privilege of a rare love magic that allows me to unite even inanimate objects. Could I see them?&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is this an innuendo? he rolls badly, so thinks it is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance: No, she wants you to cut her! JL: Oh (dejectedly) she probably did just want the daggers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nyaka wanders over to Lhaska, basking in her own heat. both of the lizards hold their tongues out, which she cuts with the daggers, which she coats in the blood which is then absorbed into the daggers, kind of like the iruvian metal. You'll find that these should perform much better when you wield them together.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For these daggers, you have the Two Weapon Fighting feat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many thanks! and he offers her a celebratory lift of his glass. Nyaka: yes, this elixer has done quite the job on my reptilian brain.&nbsp;wink&nbsp;If you ever develop a cloaca, you should come and see us. JL: given how my last couple dates have gone, that is not out of the question. Nyaka: You're very charming for a human. (SHe goes and nuzzles up next to Lhaska and falls asleep.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>intended Long Rest begins</p>\n<p>End of session</p>\n</blockquote>"}

Meanwhile, Curculio approached Drav, Fez and Paros about a message she had been sent by her friend Wodden just after he escaped the confines of a magic lake. Curculio believed that playful flowerfolk were known to swarm to the lake's bittersweet magic and, if seen, could serve as guides. Paros worried that Baphomet posed a serious threat to the flowerfolk. Fez unhelpfully misheard Baphomet as \"Bear Vomit.\"</p>\n<p>Paros went on to insult human-fox news in front of Curculio, and admitted that sourced his own news from the psychic manifestation of an evil entity known as Veenock. Curculio mentioned another friend of hers, Zadee (a competent@JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{verb runt}, which Fez believed unlikely until told of the logically rigorous 63-letter alphabet employed by many canids.</p>\n<p>Curculio, taking a moment to size up Turtle's gastronomical potential, proceeds to describe her home cuisine of @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{schilpad stoofpot}. Fez declared himself \"His Seaness\" -- a necessary ego boost before the kitsune maligns a halfling language orthography for consisting of only \"bowls and sticks.\" Fez is put in mind of @JournalEntry[K5vnCOG9BnQOCfxi]{Doodril Frogwart's Bowls and Sticks: a Confusing language for a Charming people; an Abecedarium or alphabetical Primer}. Curculio mentions @JournalEntry[93eFyj6xxNs4NYFG]{Doodril Frogwart's Secular Healing Clinic in Marshbout}, the not-unsuspicious vanguard of a series of similar clinics popping up in the major cities, and the primary distributor of the @JournalEntry[O28nh78cgullGxKO]{Secular Ministrations}, a copy of which Paros lifted from the Castle Karn library. Drav was able to confirm that @JournalEntry[X6XLSRUQLxusC8wJ]{Frogwart} was not only prolific, but prolithic, as he had penned a few flimflammminy articles on healing crystals. Paros unsuccessfully attempted to recall the method for extracting malt sugar (maltose) from barley, disappearing into one of his familiar reveries and dreaming about the fancypencils he used at the castle. Out of nowhere, Fez, determined to save the face of his people, declared that \"in our world, flowers are the children's money.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"theghostinthewoods\">The ghost in the woods</h2>\n<p>Continuing south through the forest, the group came across an innocuous ghost trapped in what appeared to be an insubstantial, evolving maze. When Fez approached, he was recognized by the spirit, which resolved into the likeness of Cpt. Juna Merrigold. Juna revealed that the death of Von Veen released her from her piscine hybrid form; however, before she could arrive at the ultimate destination on her postmortem journey, she was redirected into the limitless maze in which she now found herself. With Baphomet's influence in play, Drav thought it highly likely that an entity enjoying a boon of Baphomet, allowing one to encase people or spirits in demiplanar mazes, might be siphoning life energy from Juna.</p>\n<p>As Fez retreated into the @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{seomra crann} to clear his head and bladder, Paros, Curculio, and Drav notioned using Turtle as merely a catalyst and seasoning for a \"turtle bath stew.\" Informing Fez of this upon his return, the overconfident halfling opined on the fox fur stew so favored by halfling-kind. Curculio slashed Fez across the face for this insult, interjecting that her mother had died in the @JournalEntry[EnciK6IKgc1sVQqM]{Foxpelt Wars}, but then apologized when Fez clarified that the fur in the stew was merely shorn from willing foxes rather than made of their pelts. Paros forgot the difference between the words \"hasty\" and \"tasty\" before trying to work out with Fez the mathematics of a hypothesized interdimensional snail for which every journey was \"an hour and 50 miles.\"</p>\n<h2>Tusternoof</h2>\n<p>At that point, the gang witnessed Juna's form torn apart like curtains being drawn open as an entish creature with a motile deerskull for a head, vines and leaves streaming off its body like a tattered cloak, stepped through the opening. Announcing itself as \"Tusternoof\" or \"The twisted one,\" it attempted to imprison the adventurers in mazes like that restraining Juna. After a debate on the competing merits of halfing, grenlich, and tusternoofian land husbandry, The twisted one provided a possible clue to locating the mirror lake. Paros, realizing the unmined potential of Tusternoof's knowledge, sank deep into its mind as Fez found himself sucked into a mindmaze. Tusternoof unwittingly revealed the 'org chart' of Baphomet's followers (of which he confirmed himself a boon'd lieutenant), including a shadowy cult of @JournalEntry[iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP]{urush mekh} handling intricate metalwork skullcaps made of a reddish-gold alloy.</p>\n<p>Fez harnessed the incredible power of his mind-thoughts and collapsed the carceral psychic construct, appearing back on the material plan in a series of thin slices which coalesced into his physical form -- an event which would certainly not have any future effect on him. Drav and Paros summarily defeated Tusternoof with well-placed blobs of pure elemental energy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flowerfolk\">Flowerfolk</h2>\n<p>With the monster dead, the forest sprang to life, and Fez was drawn to a member of the Flowerfolk (or bloemenwet) in a nearby tree. The creature, named Ashtai, resembled a domestic rabbit comprised entirely of pale red and violet flower petals, and declared itself in the midst of its vacation. Paros shattered the tranquility of its aestivation by warning Ashtai of Baphomet's plans to absorb the power of the Flowerfolk. Using Ashtai as a signal booster, Paros harnesses his bracer to telepathically premonish the bloemenwet on the Slubber, receiving in return nothing but visions of holocaust. Unsure as to whether this was an oracle or had already transpired, Paros communicated his anxiety to the party. Drav recalled reading the minutes of a colloquendo conducted by dwarven geomancers: they had discussed an ancient earth spirit, Mogesh, which was reputed to guard and protect the Slubber.

The two besties then made haste to Red Fox University, where they joined the rest of the gang just before entering the redlight laboratory of visiting professor Ymenestra, an elf with shocking white hair, a wispy beard, her body enshrouded by a plaiting of rugged and durable leather straps. After some discussion it was determined that, during the attempt to kill the Baron and prevent him from inhabiting Nexnag's body, Ymenestra would apply her Vorsrunderheirer [fate runner] training and trap von Veen in a time-loop at the moment of Uugeet's death. She delivered unto Flick a crocheted bag of extradimensional capacity [a bag of holding] and in return snatched a bit of grape jerky which she proceeded to shred and use as dental floss. &bull;&bull; returned briefly at the mention of umlauts, and Flick provided to Lanharethquinsathal a flask of fizzlecyst blood and detailed instructions regarding the production of fizzlemeth from such liquid in the hopes of converting a budding classist into a dependent junkie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3da5a5e5-7fff-114a-b4d3-a296286c9505\"><br />The party returned to Uugeet's Lair where, while exchanging ribaldries with a thin-skinned Domonkos, they discovered the lakebed already drained and slick with a greasy klarshten algae which made treacherous going. Never one to shy from a fight, Joan made haste to bury Junipegg (Ethel titivating [improving the condition of] the resultant mound) and slimeslid her way to the nearest pool &mdash;&nbsp;one of two, each containing an identical image of a pallid ghostfish, telltale jagged ochre markings decorating the sides. Flick's unerring feel for the monstrous told her that the ichthyoid Joan was headed for was a phantasm, but too late! as the courageous dragonborn was flung into the water by a prehensile aqueous pseudopod. As the Baron siphoned her life energy, a selshamurrin [selkie] emerged from the water, halsed [called upon] the might of her goddess, and swealed [burned] Domonkos within a pillar of lunar light. Carlos kept Joan alive while Flick, Paros, and Drav aggrieved the great piscine beast and Fez tumbled ablely toward the fray. At long last, von Veen, doubtless feeling the inevitable departure of his power, played one final gambit, and injected falseries, simulations, and tricks [illusions] into the susceptive minds of Flick and Joan. It was too little too late, however, and Ymenestra, bolstered by divine and arcane donations, trapped the Baron in a circlet of time at the moment of Uugeet's death. As a violent concussive wave exploded outwards from Ymenestra, the selshamurrin, bereft of the animating impulse of von Veen, swooned; simultaneously, Fez, dauntless, dove soundlessly to Uugeet's unconscious form, but found himself once again transported before the ancient, primordial guardian of the seas, with a message to protect the light, and seek out Ulimara.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-db4086e6-7fff-1998-a099-4a7748f0e872\"></span></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&mdash; Maltinn of Dubrunfaut</strong></h4>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">D&eacute;but</h2>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stevie Starr</strong>: The Regurgitator.

Irritated at being taken unawares, Flick loosed an arrow, and the fight was on. Mogh thoroughly walloped everyone with falling rocks and her thick black pseudopods, but ultimately the gang triumphed. Fez's unbelievable luck allowed him to escape the brunt of the creature's body as it collapsed off the ceiling, and everyone tended to their wounds. With vampires about, though, the dead are never truly dead, and within moments a shade in the form of Domonkos had arisen from Mogh's corpse and made its way towards the platform on which the vampire remained tied. Anxious for some action, Joan grabbed a leg of the chair supporting Domonkos and pulled him onto the ground, whereupon the vampire, released from his bonds, crushed Ecks, the homunculus, and inhaled the aerosolized dust and the plasmic ghost. In that moment he put on like a coat his ancient power and declared his intent to make haste to Castle Karn. The woozy Kulgmark dwarves troddled back to their deepsome kingdom, and Domonkos roused a dormant glyph on an obscured portion of the back wall, opening up a secret tunnel. Suddenly die-curious, Paros sent the indagatory^ eddies of his sensoriolum^ wafting towards the immortal lord, but momently^ recognized Domonkos as his true friend and ally. Faced with this new quandary, Flick did what she could to erect some barriers against the further psychic intrusions of the vampire, while, in the rear of the entrain, Carlos found himself at the business end of a vengeful sap d&aelig;mon.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e031d69b-7fff-b2a8-2849-dcee89575639\"></span></p>\n<div><hr /></div>\n<div><strong>sospitators</strong>:&nbsp;Saviours, rescuers.</div>\n<div><strong>innocuity</strong>:&nbsp;Innocuousness.</div>\n<div><strong>izpakla</strong>:&nbsp;Roughly: hellhound.</div>\n<div><strong>Tantegorische</strong>:&nbsp;[Pentelow commonly employs the archaic form with the final 'e,' and that has been retained here.]</div>\n<div>\"<em>tried to crank up ... well-bearded pate.</em>\":&nbsp;Other dwarven gods of interest include: (i) Kharindlar, of healing, mercy, and, according to some, romantic love, and courtship; (ii) Volundr, of smithing, and battle-bravery; (iii) Phthah, the lame god of craftspeople and architects.</div>\n<div><strong>bifarious</strong>:&nbsp;Two-fold, double, ambiguous.</div>\n<div><strong>cephalopodous</strong>:&nbsp;Squidlike.</div>\n<div><strong>indagatory</strong>:&nbsp;Investigatory.</div>\n<div><strong>sensoriolum</strong>:&nbsp;Perh. mind?</div>\n<div><strong>momently</strong>:&nbsp;In a moment; soon.</div>\n<div><hr /></div>\n<h1>Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>transcript here goes the whole way, but very scanty</p>\n<p>[0 - 29] settling down</p>\n<p>======================</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[29- ] plot summary from last session</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[45]</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;Domonkos reveals that he knew of Lupenna and her father, Raul, the demon sorcerer.

Exuviae thought she saw a true convert in Fez, but upon anointing him with holy chrism (chunky style) the @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{thriste} halfling resisted the compulsion to wrestle naked in honor of the leprechaunic horse. Exuviae admitted that she enjoyed being a member of the bourgeois-leisure class insofar as she was able to provide a similar service gratis to interested members of the burgher demographic. She then turned a scatological imprecation into a confession, revealing that the ring of realistic genital molds kept her trapped in this ring. Carlos attempted to sell out Jean-Luc's jewels (or their negative image), before agreeing with Flick's idea to destroy the integrity of the @JournalEntry[FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA]{procreant}&nbsp;ring, a task to which they committed themselves once assured of Scrobs's neutrality by the wacky equine. Scrobs, despite the detente, remained a chip off the old block, and danced around the wood elf provocatively in hopes of eliciting a wrestling match.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smashandstab\">smash and stab</h2>\n<p>Drav, cautious of the possibly toxic genital dust pluming from Carlos's maddened swings, drew into herself, and recalled learning that rituals with similar terrestrial geometry, in the absence of a transcendental power, typically conjured their objects in pairs according to the most powerful axis of polarization: in this case, good and evil (or so she thought). Paros, spaced out for reasons altogether unrelated to his proximal physical environment recalled an ecological text which contended that the natural products of certain ancient worms had the tendency to appear differently to surface dwellers. Drav's suspicions aroused, she began further examining the rocks, and quickly determined that the igneous layer was a mere shell over a viscous brown substance.</p>\n<p>As Flick went to inform everyone of the 'planar anomalies' caused by boggle teleportations, the image of Daealla appeared to her through a Scrobs puddle and enjoined Flick to cease destroying the protective genital ring. As Flick remained unable to tear Daealla from the mirror world for a tete-a-tete, and Drav considered the implications of ancient earth-moving entities, Fez noticed that Exuviae had become transfixed by Daealla's genitals, transformed into a shining vector of pure radiant light visible in the nearest puddle.</p>\n<p>Stuck in this stalemate, Daealla confessed that the peryton raiding the gnolls had once been a fey succubus named Calliope, whose draining Kiss had been extracted into a literal and symbolic daughter named Aphelia to reduce the number of enucleated men pledging themselves to the ancient horrors. Attending to the matters at hand, the gang took a moment to catch their collective breath and then precipitously lit all the collected genitals on fire in one of the oil pits, occasioning the transformation of one of the larger rock benches into the malicious form of Gedhtathgon, a totally metal black knight, at whose beck and call Exuviae transformed into Hengest the Violent, the Neightmare of renown.</p>\n<section>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h1>Transcript</h1>\n<p>flick: unimpressive \"acrobatics\" to waddle between the rocks.</p>\n<p>orange, but purple veins in it the color of scrobs' body. dc-18 strenght saving throw or be restrained (oh, scrob's restraint puddle)</p>\n<p>exuviae does cream-cheese oil all over fez (i give him advantage because he's protected from good and evil) -- but also it's a charm spell and he's immune to charm</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fez still covered in oil</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>fez tries to make it seem like it's not the grossest thing ever.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>exuviae: you like it! is this part of your normal morning routine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sect of halflings somewhere that does this to themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>performed \"Traditional halfling ablutions\" on you -- for nothing. how's that a waste?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>exuviae gets others to do things for it, and likes being a member of the leisure class</p>\n<ul>\n<li>misses hoof attack on fez</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flick: fuck you!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>exuviae: if would make it easier to fuck me with a copy of your genitals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it's the main reason i'm trapped here.</li>\n<li>druids try to keep themselves in wrestling salad days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flick insight[20] -- not lying about being trapped here. when it's on this plane, it has to come to this area.

These four newly met sojourners agreed to proceed together for a variety of reasons which won't be examined too closely.

On the way back all three are waylaid by Thuridan, a suspicious firbolg who provides information about a potentially helpful group of druids in the northwest of the Farrest. Thuridan's magic bubble deposits them close to the gnoll village, where Carlos continues to work his healing trade. Since the trail of the flying mushrooms had gone cold, and the peryton was nowhere to be seen, Flick, Joan, Carlos, Paros and Drav set out for the Grey Tongue and Castle Karn.

Suddenly, they were attacked by a gigantic squidlike creature Domonkos referred to cryptically as Mogh. With the help of the Kulgmarkers, they defeated the beast without severe injury to themselves. Unexpectedly, its death allowed the trapped spirit of Domonkos to escape and merge with his body. He let everyone out of the cave by a secret back route.

Finally, they were pointed to Ymenestra, a visiting lecturer with a personal and professional interest in depossessions and exorcisms.</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"jmq9uvuXQcDDqA8H\"> 014. An Icky ichthorcism</a></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">With their friends gone, Fez and Flick cast their eyes about the Candy Lab and discovered a trove of chards [maps] amongst Polive Pittlan's personal possessions, one of which, being a street map of Marshbout, marked out a building with a symbol of two oxlike horns. The two besties then made haste to Red Fox University, where they joined the rest of the gang just before entering the redlight laboratory of visiting professor Ymenestra, an elf with shocking white hair, a wispy beard, her body enshrouded by a plaiting of rugged and durable leather straps. After some discussion it was determined that, during the attempt to kill the Baron and prevent him from inhabiting Nexnag's body, Ymenestra would apply her Vorsrunderheirer [fate runner] training and trap von Veen in a time-loop at the moment of Uugeet's death. She delivered unto Flick a crocheted bag of extradimensional capacity [a bag of holding] and in return snatched a bit of grape jerky which she proceeded to shred and use as dental floss. &bull;&bull; returned briefly at the mention of umlauts, and Flick provided to Lanharethquinsathal a flask of fizzlecyst blood and detailed instructions regarding the production of fizzlemeth from such liquid in the hopes of converting a budding classist into a dependent junkie.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3da5a5e5-7fff-114a-b4d3-a296286c9505\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">The party returned to Uugeet's Lair where, while exchanging ribaldries with a thin-skinned Domonkos, they discovered the lakebed already drained and slick with a greasy klarshten algae which made treacherous going. Never one to shy from a fight, Joan made haste to bury Junipegg (Ethel titivating [improving the condition of] the resultant mound) and slimeslid her way to the nearest pool &mdash; one of two, each containing an identical image of a pallid ghostfish, telltale jagged ochre markings decorating the sides. Flick's unerring feel for the monstrous told her that the ichthyoid Joan was headed for was a phantasm, but too late! as the courageous dragonborn was flung into the water by a prehensile aqueous pseudopod. As the Baron siphoned her life energy, a selshamurrin [selkie] emerged from the water, halsed [called upon] the might of her goddess, and swealed [burned] Domonkos within a pillar of lunar light. Carlos kept Joan alive while Flick, Paros, and Drav aggrieved the great piscine beast and Fez tumbled ablely toward the fray. At long last, von Veen, doubtless feeling the inevitable departure of his power, played one final gambit, and injected falseries, simulations, and tricks [illusions] into the susceptive minds of Flick and Joan. It was too little too late, however, and Ymenestra, bolstered by divine and arcane donations, trapped the Baron in a circlet of time at the moment of Uugeet's death. As a violent concussive wave exploded outwards from Ymenestra, the selshamurrin, bereft of the animating impulse of von Veen, swooned; simultaneously, Fez, dauntless, dove soundlessly to Uugeet's unconscious form, but found himself once again transported before the ancient, primordial guardian of the seas, with a message to protect the light, and seek out Ulimara.</span></p>\n<h1>Day 6</h1>\n<h3><em><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"c3KBVNZ5aiXlfqJo\"> Braggot Day</a></em></h3>\n<h3><em><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"WwbsritBW2gqo2Od\"> Raising the Pendulum Bob</a></em></h3>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"I2FBvFFPph5h81eJ\"> 015.

Drav <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> customed</a> the local post office branch to ship a frosty bottle of trollsmilk and an extensive missive to her family in Forest Ogrelodge. Fez, always perfectly in touch with his inner springwork, was motivated to call forth a steadfast steed. <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> Tregetting</a> for inspiration a piece of coral bestowed to him under miraculous circumstances, he attracted the attention of a sloppy clown named Kuma who led him to a park pond swarming with cave turtles from which the ecologically irresponsible jape gathered a healthy supply of eggrocks. Meanwhile, Carlos, having glutted his mouth and purse with vendible candies which could have been purloined for free from the Candy Lab, gawked at <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"AValwm9f8MXfp79x\"> The Unwieldy Dolphin's</a> shingle and <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> forthnimmed </a> to a desecrated former shrine to Aul&euml; being used as a social club. He attempted to preach the good word to the finger-sandwich-eating, real-estate-discussing philistines, but, unable to convert any of the nonbelievers, satisfied himself with carving a statuette of Aul&euml; into the rock wall and distributing prayer books with Drav's help. While Paros won himself a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> manuary</a> from the local villagers to free the pendulum bob from its hempen restraints and return quasi-time to the town, Flick took a moment to recall sifting some poudree [medicinal powder] from Uugeet's pool before <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> samming up</a> the party and making for the surface with Domonkos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Achieving externity [(prob.) coming to the surface] on The Grey Tongue, all but Carlos and Flick were taken unawares by two shapeless black muckhumps calling themselves Naphula and Glu&eth;er who, drawn by Drav's demon skinprint, attempted to incaptivate [capture] and dissolve the dwarven wizard. After unceremoniously roasting Glu&eth;er, the party danced around serving up Naphula in the same way until Drav could be safely extracted and Flick, amused by the ooze, could invite Naphula to confederate with them. The super-lemure having been cindered, Paros scooped some ash at the behest of Veenock and then went to get some ass with Domonkos, making it to vampire-second-but-human-third?-base, all the while chaperoned by trigger-low-affect Flick. Rather than spending the night in the woods, everyone vamoosed behind the vampire to the castle, making for the single lit room high in the central palace. The tricky little spellbook Drav snatched from Riult took one last leap at manumission and inconveniently revealed their position, but it seemed to matter not, as who should await them in the bedroom chamber but one calling herself Lupenna; and, as if that were not enough, she recognized Flick!</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"65M6uowYwFKpH914\"> 016.

Stay wove, everyone</a></strong></p>\n<p>Before bedding down for the night, Flick pressed Isabella and Lupenna on the true purpose of their plan to disguise Isabella as Lupenna while the latter skipped from plane to plane to catch <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"Mjd6QQ11FAmPlPY3\"> Tantegorische</a>. They demurred slightly when considering the arrangement in retrospect, but Isabella remained convinced that she couldn't have tended the castle in her true form without causing terror amongst the townsfolk. Flick retired rather than adumbrate a detailed genealogy with her godmother and half-aunt, and the gang awoke the next morning to delicious stacked pancakes and an invitation to assist Isabella with research into <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NmtPt8bB0bOvvEWF\"> Boggshosh</a>, the elder god. Drav and Paros, delighted by the offer, perused old tomes with Carlos at the ready in case of overexertion. Drav, ever in command of her faculties, discovered texts on the ancient rituals of Boggshuosh cultists and a loose leaf from a memoir concerning <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> Sirmgalv</a>. Paros, lost in contemplation, was Veenock'ed around and put in mind of a primeval rivalry between the evil spirit and the demon <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YHSLeWMhkn639jCi\"> Nundocamar</a>; he was further tasked with the recovery of an onyx ring with great psionic powers.</p>\n<p>Flick and Joan, meanwhile, took advantage of the crisp fall air and trekked to the North Tower, which they discovered to be more of a waystation for happenstansical travelers. Flick immediately ransacked the workshed and pilfered a pair of sealskin gloves and an unexpectedly strong rope woven out of fizzlecyst silk. Joan, convinced the tower housed eggs in need of protection, attempted to open the door from the downside up, and in so doing alerted the resident, Hale Clotwool, who introduced herself as a herder. Greeted also by the music inside (<em>Straight out the butte: never gonna' plateau</em>, by <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"IjOdh6fNMM51Ydqe\"> The Young Fustics</a>), the smells of a rich second breakfast, and the inquisitive head of a laid-up&nbsp;<em>turr</em>&nbsp;named <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"bi76sP1LQcEgLZ7k\"> Orbell Daedonbashur</a>, Joan and Flick assisted in repairing the door and casing the joint. Flick's heightened <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> conusance</a> of <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> portalian</a> japery, however, shattered the placid free-for-all and brought her face to face with an avatar of Juniper Three School; together they inferred that the reddish-gold ingots (<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"2ZjwRb6atEoekzAW\"> zlott</a>) were somehow altering the planar coherence around Egg Three School.</p>\n<p>By early afternoon everyone had reconvened at Castle Karn, just in time to witness an efflorescent belch of petals aflame exploding from Tobolux's <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> berninde</a>. It took Paros's increasingly worrisome familiarity with Veenock to make an assay at the truth: demonic <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> BaphOMO</a> got sloppy attempting to influence the current cosmological detente on <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> Thuslubber</a> and killed some 'weak and tasty' <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"J8gk7RTTA0Ziyego\"> bloemenwet</a>. Domonkos and Lupenna, unbothered by the general goings-on, began to draft up the details for an immortal castle timeshare, and the group headed towards <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"iVhprmlTtQTZBDRP\"> An Sr&aacute;idbhaile</a>.

The ones about to walk away from omelettes</a></strong></p>\n<p>Passing through the woods, the adventurers intercept an urbanite a little worse for wear who introduces himself as Jean-Luc, a somewhat disgraced occupational thief and until recently guild-bonded assassin. Sporting long blonde hair and a seven-day shadown, and swatched in a black cape and thoroughly embuckled leather armor, he's by no means hard on the eyes. Shaken by a recent vision of a ravenous wolf god abomination, he slides into the group's slipstream. Perhaps feeling bound to prove himself, he immediately offers to participate in a naked oil wrestling tournament hosted by some gaudily dressed boggles taking place inside an abandoned lavarock worm dung circle.</p>\n<p>Before long, the atmosphere becomes truly uncomfortable; Exuviae Whiffinger, a unicorn, is summoned by one of the druids in order to coat the wrestlers with orange grease. A newbie to this sort of thing, Jean-Luc undergoes some psychedelisis, which makes it even harder to refuse having a cast of his genitals made. Fez, seeing another overconfident acquaintance in need, steps in and challenges druid Dealla, but refuses to wrestle unclothed. The druids gather to discuss this unprecedented request, and Drav jumps on the clustering to lay the smackdown with a fireball. Flick rushes in to extract Jean-Luc, who begins to suffer increasingly debilitating migraines the further from the circle he gets. By this point, Drav has turned into a dwarven flamethrower repeatedly frying the oily and flammable druids. Exuviae briefly assumes her ascendant form, in which she appears as a super-ripped human with an alicorn and hooves for hands. Genital moldings appear from every available tree limb as Exuviae Hit-inger crumples Fez like a tree bark pamphlet with a crushing hoof smash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"nU20PoOeMgaaOLxv\"> 022. Riding the Neightmare: it will be blood</a></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"thebattlecontinues\">the battle continues</h2>\n<p>Flick suffered a run of bad luck, first in attempting a coolly unimpressive waddle between a pair of rocks, and then in getting Scrobs'd by a effluxion of sticky sweat. Exuviae thought she saw a true convert in Fez, but upon anointing him with holy chrism (chunky style) the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> thriste</a> halfling resisted the compulsion to wrestle naked in honor of the leprechaunic horse. Exuviae admitted that she enjoyed being a member of the bourgeois-leisure class insofar as she was able to provide a similar service gratis to interested members of the burgher demographic. She then turned a scatological imprecation into a confession, revealing that the ring of realistic genital molds kept her trapped in this ring. Carlos attempted to sell out Jean-Luc's jewels (or their negative image), before agreeing with Flick's idea to destroy the integrity of the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"FFTrvH2vtlksn2vA\"> procreant</a>&nbsp;ring, a task to which they committed themselves once assured of Scrobs's neutrality by the wacky equine. Scrobs, despite the detente, remained a chip off the old block, and danced around the wood elf provocatively in hopes of eliciting a wrestling match.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smashandstab\">smash and stab</h2>\n<p>Drav, cautious of the possibly toxic genital dust pluming from Carlos's maddened swings, drew into herself, and recalled learning that rituals with similar terrestrial geometry, in the absence of a transcendental power, typically conjured their objects in pairs according to the most powerful axis of polarization: in this case, good and evil (or so she thought). Paros, spaced out for reasons altogether unrelated to his proximal physical environment recalled an ecological text which contended that the natural products of certain ancient worms had the tendency to appear differently to surface dwellers. Drav's suspicions aroused, she began further examining the rocks, and quickly determined that the igneous layer was a mere shell over a viscous brown substance.</p>\n<p>As Flick went to inform everyone of the 'planar anomalies' caused by boggle teleportations, the image of Daealla appeared to her through a Scrobs puddle and enjoined Flick to cease destroying the protective genital ring. As Flick remained unable to tear Daealla from the mirror world for a tete-a-tete, and Drav considered the implications of ancient earth-moving entities, Fez noticed that Exuviae had become transfixed by Daealla's genitals, transformed into a shining vector of pure radiant light visible in the nearest puddle.</p>\n<p>Stuck in this stalemate, Daealla confessed that the peryton raiding the gnolls had once been a fey succubus named Calliope, whose draining Kiss had been extracted into a literal and symbolic daughter named Aphelia to reduce the number of enucleated men pledging themselves to the ancient horrors. Attending to the matters at hand, the gang took a moment to catch their collective breath and then precipitously lit all the collected genitals on fire in one of the oil pits, occasioning the transformation of one of the larger rock benches into the malicious form of Gedhtathgon, a totally metal black knight, at whose beck and call Exuviae transformed into Hengest the Violent, the Neightmare of renown.</p>\n<p><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"jF5WOcXMm4XSz2O9\"> 23.

They appear to be engaged in mining a muted blue crystalline ore, but before the adventurers can enter, the oldest human, Fundi, runs over and prevents the group from entering the ritual mining space -- for such it is -- until they've passed a bevy of personal questions. The mining team deliver their own side of the \"stolen logbook\" story, which is that the Hat Baskets stole the giant salamander's baby mandling and they hoped for a hostage exchange by stealing the book, whose power Breg believes too great to leave in Hat Basket hands. The adventurers immediately back this new horse and plan to retrace their steps to recover \"Nubbs.\" Everyone gets drunk and goes to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"6jqw928zacNmsxim\"> 047: The Order of Rust</a></strong></p>\n<p>Flick emerges from her elven trance with worrisome gaps in her memory from the previous evening; suspecting foul play, she wakes Jean-Luc to check Nyuaka's bag for poisons and narcotics, but they come up empty-handed. Nyuaka's nightmares and their conspiratorial whispering wake Drav and, as yet unbeknownst to the crew, a goblin rune knight named Pjorg (the) Tallhearted down the hall, who had lost consciousness after consuming light exploded from archaic symbols he was studying. As Pjorg creeps towards the encampment, Vengeance is awoken by qi with the urge to swallow and steal as many of the azurite prisms as possible, only to become distracted by the curious pendants worn by the Ruhu family which Vengeance believes an emblem of The Order of Rust. With Eldar's help, Drav blends mystically into the rock floor as Pjorg bursts into the cave; Jean-Luc and Flick disappear into the shadows. Vengeance bagpipes nearly everyone awake, but Pjorg is so conspicuous in his clanging shiny plate armor that all attention focuses on him. After a bit of parlay, everyone decides he means no harm. Nevertheless, the main crew, suspicious of the possibly amnesiogenic azurite after hearing it called the \"Forgetting Stone,\" pick up their bedrolls and return to their landing above the Strigge River.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"N2S9yof2MnRioM1s\"> 048: This is not for this</a></strong></p>\n<p>Pjorg translates some runes &bull; Waking up in the caves &bull; Jaap Jansen \"drops\" in &bull; Up and across the river&nbsp; (Gerd redux) &bull; The Fountain of Eloquence &bull; Jean-Luc indulges his alcoholism &bull; Pjorg sets Vengeance off on a wild rust chase &bull; Jaap sees some Gormflaith &bull; Oriax promises a meet-up</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"BJ7ThdVDRoy1Ri51\"> 049: Mise en couture</a></strong></p>\n<p>Jean-Luc's bachelorette party - Picking up a ledger at the Society of Stationers - Jaap spots the ghouls - Everyone else spots Gresh - Tailing Gresh to Two Otters Plaza - An illicit exchange spotted - To arms!</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"VrXE6qQ4eNIVhDYj\"> 050.

A second, similar creature shows up, and the two tag-team in an attempt to first wrest Drav's spellbooks from her and then, when that proves too delicate an operation, try to swallow her whole. Bolsterd by the team, the wizard buffets off attacks with her Eldarian shield until she spies an opportunity to chase after one of the creatures, wallop it with her quarterstaff, and thunderstep onto the highest building, out of the reach of the teleporting anurines. At this point, seeing the tide turn against them, the two assailants, despite their white clothes, easily disappear into the shadows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">By now it has become clear that Jean-Luc is no longer present and, after a momentarily suspecting him of turning on the group, they recognize that the attack was in part cover to abduct their roguish golden boy.

Fez refutes Abz&ucirc;. Amalia, unturned, is killed. Rotrude gives the gift of boils and her handskin. Vek makes a plea for its life. Jean-luc finally gets a star.</div>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<div>Jean-luc, operating under the impression that he is an unmoving puddle of flesh, attempts to gather himself up again using his own dissolving form. Through his lo-res eyespots he is able to locate himself vaguely in the room; occupying the site of the soil on the bar table is a nebulous swirling cloud of dirt and starlight mineral sparkles.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: You have a lot of anxiety. Perhaps just relax into your new form. Why are you resisting this after just having invoked my powers?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>This rumbling spirit voice can be heard only by Jean-luc and Hieronymus. Hieronymus goes to pour his liquid self into the vase to become one with the spirit.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, you are already quite of the flesh. I can tell that you, Hieronymus, know the relationship that transpires here.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc thinks that the process can be interrupted if he lets the spirit know what is actually going on. More panicked than anything, he attempts to move towards the bar. The intense training he's done over the years is not available to him, and he only slides about ten feet forwards. It feels to him as though he's rolling a fleshball.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: You won't be able to take advantage of what I have to offer if you resist like this.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I'm kind of a fan of having bones.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Why did you even come here, then?</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: It's a long story. I'm just along for the ride. You may have gotten the wrong idea. I ... didn't mean to offer myself.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Have no doubt you will get your bones back. I can see that already you are intellectualizing this experience, whereas the point is to retreat into yourself, and 'lose' your bones.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Who would seek out such an experience?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I can hear your friend, but I cannot talk to her unless she becomes one with my network.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: That's a hard pass.</div>\n<div>- Vek: One more step closer and I can offer that to her.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez, experiencing a lot of new things with his friends around, goes to push over the vase, [Athletics 12], really putting his \"fish-man\" scale-mailed shoulder into it. As he does so, the room rotates around him, the vase, and the table (on a horizontal axis) in the opposite direction that he's pushing. Flick sees that Fez is falling backwards to the floor after initially touching the vase. Fez, desirous of resetting the room, stops pushing the vase and comes to, prone on the ground. Fez notices that his carrying bag is beginning to undulate gently. Upon looking inside, he sees that the conch shell found on the sand after the shipwreck of the Majestic Elk is overflowing with dirt, and that thick green (in between nature and evil) tentacles are emerging from the dirt, like a hermit crab's claws. He takes the conch from the top and places it on the ground.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Fez, come to collect on our pact, have you.</div>\n<div>- Fez: New phone, who dis.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: My name is Abzu; it's \"short\" for Adzub. It is likely that your weak half human frame was too discombobulated at the time the pact was made to remember the finer details.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A rapid-fire clarification of the orthography of the creature's name takes place. Suddenly, the inimitable voice seems to trigger a memory in Fez. ... is it a boomerang? No. It's a \"memory boomerang\" from the sea. As the Majestic Elk was destroyed, and he was dragged under the surface of the ocean, the cries of the sailors of \"Kraken!\" reverberated in his mind, and he found himself wrapped in massive, thick tentacles. His eyes regained focus to find himself staring into huge expressionless eyes, churning like a hurricane. For one of the few times in his life, his self-confidence and ego were subsumed beneath a desperate plea for his life. (This couldn't be right, Fez thinks. I'd never do that.) In the memory, Abzu, for that was the kraken, let him live, as long as he committed to a pact: when it was requested, he would act in service of the beast. Some time later he found himself cast up onto the shore with the conch.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez remembers seeing it. The fact that he wasn't confident at the time couldn't be right, but it does seem like it happened to him. Unable to process something like this, he tries to turn away from the months of depression he thought might ensue.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: There's no need to be depressed. The power I'm willing to give you will compensate for any transient emotional distress.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: It doesn't sound like a great deal, and it conflicts with my visions of more benevolent sea monsters.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: What is there about me that's not benevolent?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Your creepy voice, your tentacles, and the destruction of a ship.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Well that ship was in my waters -- and many of those aboard were enemies of the Krakens.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Why?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: They are a coastal people and have animosity towards those who wish to share the sea with them.</div>\n<div>- Fez: It doesn't seem like you're sharing the sea with them at all -- you were the aggressor.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: After they demonstrated they were xenophobic, I decided to trade them an eye for an eye.</div>\n<div>- Fez: So the things people did to you, you did back to them. That's not benevolent.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: I protect the sea creatures.</div>\n<div>- Fez: What do you eat?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Algae.</div>\n<div>- Fez: You sure?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: That's it.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez is pretty sure that algae and plankton go towards its diet.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: The blue whale is even larger than I am, and it's sustained on krill.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yeah but it's a mammal.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Right, so its metabolism is even higher.</div>\n<div>- Fez: So you're saying it's worse than you?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Is a tortoise worse than a mouse?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yes.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: You were only recently riding on a turtle.</div>\n<div>- Fez: How do you know that?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: You made a pact with me!</div>\n<div>- Fez: That doesn't sound right. Can you show me where I signed?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: It's not my fault that mortal memory is so easily destroyed.</div>\n<div>- Fez: None of this adds up correctly.</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Fine, if you don't believe me, the next time you go to swipe at one of these many enemies -- attend to what occurs, and it will be clear that I provide your power to you.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Even if that's true, what were the terms of the pact?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: When I need you, you will be there to serve me. A war is brewing, and even these minor excursions by the Teallacht could be dissuaded with your involvement.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Why are you talking to me now?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: Something about the way you lost life after we made our pact rendered our continued conversations impossible. Through the influence of Vek, you are reduced to what is fundamental about your body, and that has allowed me to talk to you again.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Can we return to our previous relationship? Where you shut the fuck up and I go on my way?</div>\n<div>- Abzu: If you wish</div>\n<div>- Fez: Great -- so be it. And a reminder that this is the first pact I've made with you.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>A discussion of bags, shells, and halfling racism ensues as Fez and Abzu attempt to hang up on one another.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Yeah -- our adventuring team only has one famous hobbit!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>(From the outside room)</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Carlos!!</div>\n<div>- Flick: What the fuck was that?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>With Flick's superior elven hearing she can determine that Amalia is still quite far down the hallway. Hieronymus meanwhile slides into Vek's DMs in an attempt to pour himself into the vase.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Yes, spirit, let us commune. Let me absorb your nutrients and grow into the mighty oak that I have always longed to be.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Before you become the oak, you must become a grub.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: I thought if anything I'd have to become an acorn first.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Acorns are much tougher and resilient than those who come to me wish to be. But you may crawl towards me slowly, little grub.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Uh..... ok!</div>\n<div>- Vek: When you mortify yourself, do you know about the energy that ... flows through the universe.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: ... what? Yes, I know all about that. Am I not talking to myself?</div>\n<div>- Vek: This is Vek. Victor. Echo. Karate.</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: Well, Mr. Vik, I agree, I'd like to become part of you. May we commune in a beautiful fusion of flesh and soil?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, I'm glad I don't have to convince you like I do Jean-luc.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Yes, he's just an old fuddy-duddy who never wants to do anything fun.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc (nodding): Yeah, both of you enjoy your blood orgy.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez [Con 5], hearing Vek's low-decibel, extra-low-frequency whispers, hurls chunks all over the place.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I quite like this \"Not having any bones\" thing. Bones, as it turns out, were an unnecessary luxury. Life is a lot simpler this way. I can't wait to harvest this divine energy so I become even more powerful.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: The way to the divine energy is to let go of your bones. To become nothing but flesh.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: So, mission accomplished!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus then passes out. Void. Small elven boy. Equally as weird looking. At the horizon of his tunnel his parents are fishing. Instead of physical forms he sees their ki. But looking down at himself he just sees his body: the body of a child. His parents turn to look back at him; as they do he feels an intense, direct hostility coming from them. Then they are yanked out of his vision, and he's left there with no one to protect him.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Kid Hiero: Mommy, daddy! Why are you gone before I got a chance to tip your boat over and drown you?!</div>\n<div>- Mom: Heiro, you were always such a rascal. We don't know where you got it from, but it's too much for us, and we're done with you.</div>\n<div>- Kid Hiero: Ohh. Where will I find my ki now? My ky. The key to my existence.</div>\n<div>- Mom: If only you would stop looking -- perhaps then, it will emerge from within you, rather than always stay out of your grasp.</div>\n<div>- Kid Hiero: Stop looking, you say.</div>\n<div>- Mom: Indeed.</div>\n<div>The sky appears to wink, and Kid Heiro takes a whittled wooden dagger and stabs them into his eyes, just like the darts into Shoemaker Byte's eyes. As he does that, he suddenly sees, even eyeless, the pure representation of ki across the night sky. He then wakes up, on the floor of the bar.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: All has been revealed to me. From this day forward, I shall have a new name: VENGEANCE.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Everyone doooooes experience it differently.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Maybe we need to overload the dirt with non-dirt.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Curse this backwards! Curse your curse nuts!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Carlos calls down the divine energy of Aul&euml; to rend the vase apart, but the vase merely jiggles excitedly and settles back on the table.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: My Hammer! Shatter this perverted symbol of vulgarity!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The hammer courses towards the glass container and smashes against it. A crack running from base to rim forms, and soil begins to drain out of the vase. Jean-luc for a brief moment senses his cool sturdy bones. He rises to his feet, throwing off the hallucination like a blanket, confident in his sprightly frame. He grabs the kettle and goes to wing it at the vase.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I can finally come up there! Perhaps we can make our way to your dental appointment together.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I am a changed man, now. I wish to make up with you and go fishing and huckleberry'ing as we once did.</div>\n<div>- Flick: Don't be a simp, Heironymus!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: That sounds wonderful. Perhaps this time we might bring a chaperone in case one of us needs resuscitation.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well, we're adults. I think we can handle ourselves.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I certainly believe that you can handle yourself, but I think I might need assistance. I don't know if you were able to drag me from the depths as quickly as I'd like.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I'm kind of like ... the most powerful person in the world now. I don't have time to explain.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Have you been off on one of your meditative journeys again? And what is this fascinating energy coming from the room you're in.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: That is the dirt spirit.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Well I will be right up, and perhaps we do find a chaperone.</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well, Jean-luc here looks up to me as a mentor and is a good friend, and might fit the bill.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I do not look up to you as a mentor, you crazy asshole!</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well then Jean-luc perhaps you would like to be the first to jump into the swirling dirt here.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Your friend sounds audibly disgusted! There is quite a lot of dry-heaving coming from that room.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick, encouraged by the crack in the vase, leaps ten feet towards the table on which it rests. She sees Rotrude, dressed in simple blacks and greys and dripping with brackish water, through the open door. She fires a force-arrow at it, but it wraps around the vase like light bending in water. Forgoing a sharpshoot opportunity, she looses a regular arrow, quickly retreating out of the proximity of the vase. Fez, having had a moment to strategize, lashes his whip towards the vase in the hopes of dragging it off the table; the heavy vase smashes against the floor, the lid smashing but the vase remaining upright, still spilling dirt.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: There's no need to destroy me. I was only being invited into your minds by Shoemaker. People usually come to me of their own volition.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez recognizes the possible truth of this plea.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: If you want \"Live and let live,\" can you ... go dormant? And we can just leave you?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I wouldn't mind if you deposited my soil in a local ... heap ... of soil.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I, Fezziwig Hornswoggle, (making the 2nd pact of my life) --</div>\n<div>- Abzu: &lt;Would you like to renew our pact?&gt;</div>\n<div>- Fez: No!</div>\n<div>- Vek: Was that a benevolent kraken talking to you?</div>\n<div>- Fez: It was a non-benevolent kraken.</div>\n<div>- Vek: I know of no such thing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: You're literally dirt.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Dirt is only the vessel through which I can become manifest.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Then how do you know about water creatures?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I don't understand the question.</div>\n<div>- Fez: You retreat your presence into your soil; we will take you out to an inviting spot and deposit you there.</div>\n<div>- Flick (embarrassed at having missed a stationary pot): I agree wholeheartedly</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I agree as well, as long as you allow me to become the seed I have always wanted to be, and implant myself into the soil so that I may become a mighty oak.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Anything that lets me keep my bones is ok with me.</div>\n<div>- Vek: The bones always come back after a time.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: Not good enough.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Heiro, since when have you taken such an interest in plant-life. I thought you were more of a poison guy.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Well yes, poison comes from plants. When I was a boy, all I ever wanted to be was a tree.</div>\n<div>- Vek: This is fascinating. and you were aware of this before today's visions?</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Yes, I was. But now -- I have a renewed purpose. Like when you come back from a year abroad. I know now that I cannot simply be a tree (altho I would like to try that at some point). I have to find the sorceress and give her a good wallop after I am powerful enough to do so.</div>\n<div>- Vek: As a plea for my continued accompaniment, if you look inwards towards yourself you will see that our interaction has renewed your connection with Ki. [Heiro recovers 6 ki points.]</div>\n<div>- Fez: If I wanted to dispose of a seashell and have it decompose in the dirt. And the malevolent presence inside it.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, it could work. There is a risk that it could escape from the physical constraint. A pretty high risk. I don't like to overestimate my skills.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Is it like a minimal effort for you? Or you and Hieronymus could co-exist with that power.</div>\n<div>- Vek: If it's a shell, I'm not sure I would be up to the task. It's hard to convince a shell to return to its fleshy blob state.</div>\n<div>- Fez: What about a kraken?</div>\n<div>- Vek: A little tadpole kraken?</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yeah ... he fits in this shell.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Then possibly.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Well what if it happens to be a small version of a larger kraken.</div>\n<div>- Vek: I am good at suppressing spirits if they can be isolated from their physical forms. It's rare for krakens to be spirits, though.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Can they communicate at a distance?</div>\n<div>- Vek: If you made a pact with them. The Quacken.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I'm not typically in the business of not honoring my pacts, so I'll just keep it.</div>\n<div>- Vek: You're the kind of guy who, no matter what he's doing, _thinks_ he's honoring a pact.</div>\n<div>- Fez: That is deeply true. Because of tautology.</div>\n<div>- Vek: This explains a lot, really.</div>\n<div>- Fez: Are you and Hieronymus going to become a tree together?</div>\n<div>- Vek: Hieronymus may have misunderstood what the soil component of me is for.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hieronymus: All I wanted was to soil myself. I don't understand why that's so hard</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: We can soil one another together once I get up there!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I know I said we could be friends again, but that was a passing mood, so I don't want to see you.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: So you want a 'two-hurls-one-monk' situation?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: No. No.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Why not? If you don't desire me, what do you wish for?</div>\n<div>- Heiro: I can take care of it. Just please retreat to your dungeons or your catacombs, wherever you came from. [Fails a persuasion check]</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Oh, I can tell you're just kidding. I'll be right up.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc moves as far as he can from Vek and upturns a bottle of disgusting, yet effective, hard spirits. The liquid is quite murky. Fez notices that one of his whip tassles is poking out of Vek's soil, and he goes to wiggle it free, but comes up with just a root.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: I do love a good head massage. Whatever you want to call it.</div>\n<div>- Fez: My apologies.</div>\n<div>- Vek: Yes, you are coming to know yourself through my intervention.</div>\n<div>- Fez: NOW who's overly confident?</div>\n<div>- Vek: I'm a spirit. I'm allowed to be.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez and Vek discuss the notion of an entity's right to be overconfident. Turns out, The Best The First Halfling said \"Freedom is a right of all living beings.\" Fez agrees to 'companion' his friends to help Vek back onto the table. Amalia runs into the room, past the dissipated vapors of Eldar.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Amalia: Carlos, I can't be held responsible for what I'm about to do after you abandoned me in that cave-in only to come in here for a drink. ... Like I said, no one could blame me for not being able to hit.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Amalia hits him with a crossbow bolt which retains a tenebrous tether to her, which throbs with stolen life energy.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Amalia: I'll take from you the life that you denied to me!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Do I hear the pitter-patter of my dear Hiero's feet.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I just want to live my life, MAN!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Displacing his anger onto this new arrival, Hieronymus batters Amalia with his Karbunqlestaph. Hieronymus slides down his staff, sliced by the protruding thorns and lubricating it with blood. While being drained, Carlos, not his usual self, wiffs with his battleaxe and coughs unhelpfully. Then Rotrude comes in!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: We can finally tussle like we're used to. Just get those little hammy fists up, let me see what we can do!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Hammy?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>With her jagged, shredded nails she claws into Hieronymus, and where she slashes the monk his skin begins to bubble with blueish blisters, and a mild neuropathy settles into his limbs.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I hope you like this bit of torture I've devised. It allows for a bit more pain during our sparring.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: A touch of hurt, you say?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hiero squeezes a boil and a thick, blue liquid jets out and into Rotrude's eye, which immediately swells and takes on the cast of one of the boils themselves.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: What have you done? This isn't what I agreed to!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I'm sorry but it seems as though you broke the rules, and the gloves are off.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: How interesting that you should say that!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Rotrude pulls off the skin of her hands up to the elbows, like gloves.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: A duel it is, then!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick, worried about Carlos and attempting to suppress the revulsion at what she witnessed with Rotrude, closes to within two rods, shatters the very fabric of Amalia's being, and then shoots an arrow into Rotrude.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Is this part of the new techniques you mentioned?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Stay still while I make a portrait of you!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: You should use some fluid from the boils on your arm!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc skips into the fray and delivers another deep wound.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Distance fighters look to be your main companions now?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: These are my followers; they haven't learned how to fight yet.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc and Flick: Don't lump us in with him!</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Given the distance between all of you: we already have a strong friendship foundation; yet you all treat each other as the same pole on a magnet.</div>\n<div>- Fez (after a long delay): what's a magnet?</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: What about the concept of magnetism?</div>\n<div>- Fez: What? The compass points the direction. North.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez then \"applies\" a whipping.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I thought you said you were going to give me a solid whipping, not a one-and-done.</div>\n<div>- Fez: I genuinely thought you couldn't take another hit and felt pity for you.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: I doubt that this human frame can withstand much more. In the monastery we are taught many ways to consider the human form.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Yeah, well, to me, you look like an undead horror show.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus, utterly fed up, tears the undead monk to pieces.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Perhaps we shall meet again.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Yes, we will always be twins, circling one another, like two halves of a symbolon.</div>\n<div>- Hiero: I'm not sure I would go that far.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Would you go to the ends of the earth for me?</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Well, that's not that far.</div>\n<div>- Rotrude: Yes, the monastery taught us we live on a very very small, two-dimensional planet. Goodbye my hairy mouse!</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Goodbye my lovely serpent sister.</div>\n<div>- Flick (After a beat): Enough of that pervert shit.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The gang listens intently for footsteps; Fez, glancing around the room, casts his eyes over Shoemaker, her greataxe, the skin of Rotrude's de-gloved hands. Flick dances sprightly over to Carlos and tries to draw any evil out of him and into the void.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: I think I just need to sleep for a long time -- regain my ruddy dwarven complexion -- and this will all go away like a bad dream.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick hands him a goodberry, and he chokes it down despite his nausea and Shoemaker's warnings. The wood elf then trips over to Shoemaker's body, determining for good that she's a bear only with opposable thumbs and the ability to walk upright with ease. Flick remembers that ordinary folks think of these things as ursothropes, but there doesn't appear to be any shapechanging going on, as such creatures are supposed to return to their \"default\" state at death.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: What am I supposed to make of this!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She's not a werecreature, and this is probably just her species, a kind of permanently hybrid species. [Int 1] She is from an ancient line of humans, from which druids \"evolved.\" Flick picks up 39 uncrushed goodberries which dropped out of Shoemaker's paws upon her earlier entrance. They are vines, like grapes -- not like the individual and separate berries she typically receives; they clearly grow somewhere, which she would never have guessed before. The one rotten goodberry that appeared at Castle Karn had really freaked her out.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick (mumbling to herself): Yes, the humans I know _are_ pretty hairy. I don't want to skin a sapient creature.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Her hand briefly touches some of the soil.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: The berries, they grow around Shoemaker's house.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: Sorry about trying to break your vase. Sorry about that.</div>\n<div>- Vek: That means a lot.</div>\n<div>- Flick: How did you get here? I had always heard that she lived near where I grew up. Did you take some kind of portal here?</div>\n<div>- Vek: My jar is in Shoemaker's basement. I'm not just waiting in there, though. People have to come by and invoke me. I'm always popping up all over the place.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Flick: so Shoemaker summoned you once she had tracked me down. If we were to scatter your soil, you'd be able to unbind and return whence you came.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Vek: Unbinding isn't a problem but I don't like to have unnecessary duplicates of myself hanging around.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick finagles the vase into the bag of holding, while Jean-luc notices that the kettle radiates indeterminate magic.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Carlos: Aule seems to think this is more druid magic rather than anything arcane.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Fez: Hey, I bet I know what that thing does. You take crabs, and boil them -- then the shells go all soft and you can get into the meat.</div>\n<div>- Jean-luc: I do enjoy a good seafood feast.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc grabs some clarified alcohol in a distinctive bottle bearing a silver eight-pointed star etched into the bottle. Hiero goes over to Jean-luc, puts a chair behind him.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Hiero: Jean-luc, why don't you sit down for a second, there's something we have to talk about. [Jean-luc remains standing] I know that you think we came down here to fight some undead creatures, but actually this is an intervention. I'd like you to give me your bottles; i'll keep them safe. To make headway we need you at 100%, and you weren't really all that much help in the last bottle.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-luc walks away stoically.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- Heiro: Suit yourself. If you ever want to talk, I'll be here.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick throws the departing rogue a goodberry. After eating the berry, Jean-luc's desire for drinking increases. Poking around behind the bar, he finds 70 gold in the till. Jean-luc, not looking to take money from a hardworking establishment underground in a creepy temple, leaves the gold. But, lying right in his line of sight, he sees a star matching the one on the bottle exactly, and he pockets it.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>"}

Footh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the city of Cressida, wood elf Flick approaches @JournalEntry[Y2RvKXhrDTaTEqAp]{Remy Flitch}, a well-known crew leader, for information about an enigmatic statuette she&rsquo;s been carrying with her since adoption. Remy&rsquo;s thaumaturge @JournalEntry[330wC7yDCgeUQxOX]{Snav}, after inspecting the artifact, grotesquely directs her to a &lsquo;Lupenna&rsquo; near the town of Marshbout. Remy, though annoyed by Flick&rsquo;s importunity, dispatches Joan &mdash; travelling to Marshbout on her own assignment &mdash; as a chaperone.</p>\n<p>They both make their way south until a deceptively adorable bearcublike creature sporting a single spiral horn on its forehead impedes their passage over a stone bridge. Joan&rsquo;s attempts to platonically embrace the creature are misinterpreted as aggression, and she allows herself to be flung to the side so as to spare it any embarrassment. Flick, evincing her trademark uncircumspect insistency, presents the creature with her onyx figurine. The Zorbo, upon touching the object, begins to take on its material attributes (for such, they surmised, is the way of Zorbon), only to be afflicted by something far more powerful, and collapses. They administer to the cub as best they are able, but only time and physical contact with its fieldstone home would help the cutie, so they proceed apace to Marshbout.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Drav, a dwarf wizard raised by elves in Forest Ogrelodge, adventured westward in order not just to meet more of, and learn the ways of, her race, but also to expand the ambit of her academic knowledge. At the foothills of the Steeple Peak Mountains, she was introduced to Carlos the Dwarf, a cleric about to travel to Marshbout to donate his healing expertise to the beleaguered community there.</p>\n<p>They were offered a ride by the stormless cloud giant Rufus Skyflume. After a day in his makeshift wagon surrounded by longhaired cloud cattle and a shorthaired favorite named Priscilla, they parted ways at Balach Pass when Rufus headed north to visit a family member. What should have been a half-a-day&rsquo;s march to town elongated somewhat when they passed by Mirror Lake, whose strange magic required that they swap some possessions before escaping its spatio-temporal loop. They arrived in Marshbout later that afternoon, and, while making their way to the Perch Office to send messenger owls with letters of safe arrival to their families, Drav sighted an enormous cat. When they inquired of the loquacious Perchmaster General Buddock as to any events or conditions requiring clerical ministration, he mentioned a few instances of exploding bodies and zombified cats, but could not comment as to the &lsquo;pig-sized&rsquo; feline of Drav&rsquo;s report. He was able to point them towards Norman Barrelchest, one of the town&rsquo;s constables (in charge of the armamentarium and responsible for ensuring the safety of the nearby highways).</p>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>"}

(He has eaten \"Elephant Badger\" with mushrooms, a dish from his childhood. Elephant badgers are not taxonomically related to badgers. All the animals are given a large animal and a small animal name (which you'd think would have psychologically prepared him for this dual condition he finds himself in) depending on how you feel about them. So you say them both when you're cooking them, but if you feel bigger than them when you're \"out with them\" you call them an e.g. badger , but if you're sitting down or taking a nap then you would refer to them as an elephant badger?</p>\n<p>[In-laws talk]</p>\n<p>No real language scholars amongst the goliaths. \"They would dispute the existence of scholars at all, among every discipline everywhere.\" They like to dispute.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Whatever's going on is going on in that house. I shall sprint towardseth the house!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rich spider venom of the Poras Spiders is too buttery for Pjorg's taste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flick's back is against the tower door. She uses her bonus action to cast Zephyr's Strike. She dismisses Etherealness because Pelageena can apparently see her anyway. She makes her first weapon attack with Advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Treating it like P. has not acted in the combat round yet. 21 Piercing on force arrow 25 piercing. She does not fail any concentration checks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though Flick shoots the sorceress with two arrows, they don't throw Pelagena off her routine. The runes that cover all four walls, and the floor and ceiling; they glow brightly each time she's hit, and Flick can see blood dribbling down from the runes.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick's speed is 75.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She is so mad that doing \"so much damage\" didn't throw the sorceress off her game, and wishes she could make a shove attack. Instead, she ... runs away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The staircase is a spiral stone staircase. She runs down it about 15 feet to obscure herself.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She doesn't have to concentrate on favored foe.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Flick runs for the stairs, as she dashes past them hears a cacophany of screaming whispers which sound like they're coming from -- she turns to look -- a wall of black void that''s swelling behind her, and she hears slurping mouth sounds. She feels ghostly tentacles chasing at her feet, and the darkness engulfs her as she runs out of breath. She's utterly blind, but begins to feel a sharp chill and the passage of slimy tentacles.</p>\n<p>Even blinded, she can tell when the tendrils come up against her, and can skip out of the way, but it is somewhat exhausting. When the droplets fall onto her skin, it feels like milky fizzlecyst acid.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pelageena summons a shadow spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JL is lassoed by dark cloudy whisps, and pull his own flesh out of him in slices, and his skin knits back together in greyish gooey webbing. As this happens, he imagines that Vengeance climbs through the window and plays his bagpipes in an effort to prove he's a triple threat, and the discordant notes of his bagpipes distract the ritual caster.</p>\n<p>Vengeance thinks they're going for a fast-pased witty action play, so chooses the Ten Axe character, giving him screwball dialog even though there' snone for him that he saw in the playbook. He pulls out his bagpipes. \"If this doesn't impress you and prove that I'm a triple threat, I don't know what will.\" and he begins playing the overture to Ten-Axe kills the witch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As V tries to hop in, he realizes he's coming up against a force field, but he can still hear what's going on inside. And he can see a human shadow creature hulked up next to a hemisphere of darkness in the rear corner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>V performs the bagpipes, and assumes this is a window that can be broken by a high-frequency noise like a champagne glass.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I roll concentration against his performance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a second she attends to what he's doing, and he detects faint ripples appearing in the force window, but she continues gavorting and gallavanting around the room, but gesticulating precisely and in a practiced manner, but also wildly. IT looks like she has a great tech department behind her; as she points to the glyphs, in turn, each one of them lights up and then fade back into reddish embers as she plicks out the next one.</p>\n<p>Vengeance is really getting into the role now, and shouts, \"Out, foul witch!\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intimidation with disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She hears him, and V can see that she raises her head and laughs. It seems like the sound engineer has turned up the volume inside to attempt to drown Vengeane out. Vengeance thinks about sundering the window, but nothing at the monastery acquainted him with this sort of magic, which makes him think it's immune to a lot. It probably doesn't extend the length of the wall, so the stone next to it probably doesn't have a force wall behind it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He then remembers a window in the floor below that is quite narrow but could accommodate his slim form.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dex KL. 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As he's trying to get in, he loses his grip and slides down another 10 feet before he can catch himself. On the first floor, finally, he cranks his mediumshanks into the window aperture. he's in a room that's covered in old slate broken into pieces. To his right there's a door frame, and it's been blown off it's hinges. It lies shattered in pieces off to the right, in that room. Coming from that room he sees an eerie greenish pulsing glow. He moves towards that. The broken slate has spilled out into this room, primarily because the floor is a sloping dirt floor. at the far end of the room is a slick, algae-covered pool of water which ripples slightly as he steps into the room. another pool has formed in a depression in the middle of the room. between them lies a kind of stony path, and at the far wall is the remnants of a wooden catwalk.</p>\n<p>\"This is kind of a weird green room, but this is definitely my style. It will give me some place to relax before my audition.\" He sees something to the left that could be waterbottles and snacks. he knows that's always a test. for the most part they are ceramic jars with lids of varying sizes. a few are cracked and covered in cobwebs, but a few look dust-free and like they're been handled recently. He sits and waits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg is still outside, and runs as far as he can.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DC 15 wisdom save. 4 points of necrotic damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He sees a blackish-grey cloud hoveer above his head like an anti-halo and settle into his mind. He's beset by the frightening vision of furniture that is larger than he is and particularly large doorways. Looking at the manor house, seeing the arched double-doorway, which gets larger and larger and eventually dwarfs the house, such that it's a yawning portal larger than what it leads into. and he also remembers as a child he was read the story of Matilda, a little goliath child who puts shims of wood under their grandparenth's goliath cane and table and confuses them until they get dimentia which is caused by the discrepancy between how tall they are and how tall they think they are , but he remembers that it 's a children's story and that he'd gotten over the fear by telling himself he'd never be small ever again and do nothing but grow taller until he got old, and by force of Mind Strength, shrinks down the apparent image of the door.</p>\n<p>Jaap considers trying to get to someone and bring them with him, but, that option notwithstanding? he dimension door's up into the tower room. A huge globe of darkness around his the air is frosting, and milky-white tentacles that lick the air.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Drav first showed up at the estate in daylight, she couldn't see anything by darkfall an actual tornado had begun to form, centered on the hill.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investigation 24.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She thinks it wasn't expanding; it may have been increasing in strength, but it wasn't moving, within the radius stopping at the stables.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: You've got ao pretty good setup here, but that tornado's looking pretty nasty, I'm not sure, even if you're able to hang out in there for a few hours, i'm not sure what the world is going to look like. we've been able to get ourselves out of pretty difficult situations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She puts a lot of dwarven pathos into the plea.</p>\n<p>T: I know that they estate is going to be destroyed; that's exactly what my sister wants. I can't go up against her and I can't leave until the spell keeping me here is nullified.</p>\n<p>Drav: Why can't you go up against her? Is there some way we can help?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tishara: I brought you here to help ... I learned that you were my only chance to keep the estate up. I'm hoping you can do what I can't.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: Well even if you're not able to contest her directly, I'm sure you know there's a lot you know about what she's doing, and specific things that can help. Isn't there anything you can tell us?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tishara: My sister spent a lot of time learning about the different planes. It's magic I've intentionally avoided; as far as that goes I have very little help to offer. I do know that that black stone in the amphitheatre is the source of what's happening. Aside from removing or destroying that or killing or incapacitating my sister I don't know how this can be stopped. She has so many wards that she's put in place in that tower, and she can direct the forces of what's going on, and it's too much for me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: That's already more than we knew before coming here, so I think you can still help us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tishara: I'm not sure why i'm telling you this, but most of what i've done is to maintain 'believable inaction' [plausible deniability] where if she knows i've participated in stopping her plans then I'll be a target of her vengeance as long as i live. Usually this is where someone would say \"and now I have to kill you for telling you that.\" but I don't want to break the sanctity of my little mansion here. you're safe for now! and that's only a joke, too, haha.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: There's no reaon you have to help out in a visible way. We can say 'Oh, who, Tishara? Who's that? We came on this information in a completely unrelated manner'</p>\n<p>Tishara: I don't want to uh ... criticize you ... but even your friend Vengeance's acting chops are better than what I heard now. I'll tell you whatever I know that can help you, but I really don't want to leave this spot. I don't want the estate destroyed -- that's my inheritance, and it's why she seeks to destroy it! But I would rather have my life than property, as it comes down to it.</p>\n<p>Drav can put it together that part of this is a quarrel between two rich sisters, but not the part where one sister would turn to a cataclysmic outcome out of spite.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: You don't have to leave this hut, as long as you tell me anything of use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav does&nbsp;not&nbsp;say that she will collapse the cave on Tishara.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>T: I know that her interest here goes beyond even my sole inheritance. She's also taken this as an opportunity to experiment with means of siphoning power from the other planes. Once, when we were still on speaking terms, she'd had a little too much Tepplin whiskey that night, and revealed to me what I thought were drunking ramblings of a planar magic pedant, but what she had said was that the Ethereal Plane acts as a switchboard for magic, and one grows to great, it evens that out by delivering that to another plane. which in her mind is why the material plane has magic at all, so she believed that if she could collapse the two into one, she would have access to all the magic of all the planes which was superabundant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As to what the black rock is, I know that less than a year ago there was a large explosion south of here, and a few nights after she took three or four carts south of here, and coming back one of the carts was loaded such that it was low on its axels. She must have brought it back then, but I don't know where it came from.</p>\n<p>As far as getting to her through the mansion, the house is full of glyphs especially coming up the staircase. She has so many rooms in that place now that our mother has been absent for years, I hesitate to guess what crude experiments are going on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: Any of that could be the key to defeating her. And one more thing ...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tishara's timeline matches up with what Nuphar the newly Naiad had said about an explosion or meteorite that landed and created the Planhage lake. The only thing that matches the description of the rock is when she looked at the Gormflaith brooch, inside the turqoise and iridium.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav: I think we'll work something out. Thanks?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And she chuggs out and up to Longcoat, and they make it about 1/3 of the way to the house, coming just under the swirling gouts of earth and cloud.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc, in pretty bad shape, unstraps the cast iron helmet from his ... belt ... ? and polymorphs into a werebear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"As a bear\" I want to charge forward , growl, and blow the doors off this manor house. This iron-banded wooden door isn't knocked fully out of the frame, but they're split at the center, and then swing all the way around until they split against the inside stone walls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc-Bear smashes into the foyer, looking at a large rug on the wall, a bear head mounted on a shield backing staring at him from the opposing side, and quite a few doors leading off .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Smell-based perception check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He can't differentiate floors all that well -- most of the organic smelling matter is coming from the left, under or in the tower.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WIS KH. d 15</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As he walks further into the foyer, he's not sure if it's the new form or the raw power, but it feels like he's seeing a warp in spacetime, and he can see a little silverfish crawling across the ground moving very slowly, and a grey glyph shining out from each of the mounted bear's head's eyes. He surmises (smells) that he's avoided the effects of a 'slow' spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I have an attack, I'd like to attack the silverfish. He attacks with both claws; it's so small he hits it with his literal south paw -- it's obliterated so thoroughly it looks like he has silver nailpolish on a claw.</p>\n<p>In the darkness, Flick assumes that it's something that she tripped, like some ladder she set off, but the longer she sits the colder she begins to feel, as her toes and fingers start to get frostbite and her eyelashes frost over. She feels her way back up the stairs and out into the light, sees Jaap has made it into the room, and a shadowy human figure , and the brain ooze that's made it into the room. She reaches out through the quickly merging planes and gives Pelageena \"both barrels\" . She pulls the string back, as the arrow sizzles and sparks, (so uses Favored Foe this time) -- this knocks her forard, away from Flick, but (concentration check) she's able to incorporate the hit into her bows and straightening. She moves with her back against the wall and window, and joins Jaap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap, (since Michael's missed half a turn from computer business) sees Flick burst out of the darkness, shattering frost in the air and herself covered in small icicles, her hair crispy with crystals. And a pile of yellowish-orange goop, with the distinctive chunks of brain tissue in it. Jaap casts Spirit Guardians, exempting Pjorg (is that Pjorg out there?) and Flick.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What do the Spirit Guardians look like? Fey creatures, pixies sort of. Trickster Fox, Badger, and Elephant Badger</p>\n<p>[ more about in-laws and trickiness]</p>\n<p>Pjorg avoids some necrotic tendrils lashing out at him; he stands stoically still and the tendrils assume he's going to move, but he doesn't -- they are in a stand-off. they lose interest after a moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Vengeance waits in the room, he sees rising to the surface of the lake, half a dozen large cocoons that look almost like slugs made of paper mache or dried algae preserved in an oily film; the pond is acting like a tidal body, depositing them and retreating.</p>\n<p>Vengeance, to himself, \"We used to have these at every on of my birthday parties. I mean, not mine, because they never threw me a party, but all of my friends had one at their birthday parties, and they loved them, they were always filled with slugs and maggots and grubs\" and he takes his quarterstaff and tries to hit one of them like a pinata.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He smashes into the cocoon that looks the plumpest, and filled with delicious treats. [and it looks like ...] as he gets close he sees that there is a shape throbbing inside through the translucent skin of the cocoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"I hope it's a floating eel, they are always the tastiest.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inv. nat 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's definitely going to be a floating eel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As he smashes the cocoon, the seams between the bits of vegetal wrapping begin to separate, and the delicious thick body of an eel, covered in his favorite natural eel sauce excretion, squeezes out through the integument of the cocoon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abandoning his quarterstaff, he drops to his knees and begins to claw ineffectually at the tough casing of this thing. \"It's always harder when you're not blindfolded\" he murmurs to himself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He sees that, of the ones he's come close to, they are beginning to extrude bluish-green tentacles humping directly towards him. He reaches out and tries to open the cocoon and see what's inside. Immediately he realizes it's not one of his favored eels; it's covered in a sort of fur or hide. It appears to be a huge cat, an adult cat, but the size of a pig. It looks to have been extracted too soon, as there is no life in its eyes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Well the cat's out of the bag. i guess i'll try to wake it up.\" and begins gently to stroke its goopy ears.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Medicine check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As he does this, Vengeance accidentally transfers qi, and the creature opens its eyes and begins to purr and halfheartedly lick the goo off itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm sorry Roxfallanah, I believe I've found my new partner. It was just never meant to be, professionally speaking. What do you think ... would you like to join me in my audition?&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Animal handling KL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Its ears are so full of the glue that it doesn't appear to have heard it. Vengeance thinks it might be a good idea to clean the placental film off the creature. Let's get those ears cleaned! and he puts his thrush shoes on the ends of his self-killer and use as a q-tip .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg makes his way into the front door that's been \"born\" open. Pjorg says this and chortles to himself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Was Pjorg accused of being a pedant in Goliath society for all his puns? \"They don't have a word for that, but yes: they made one up. It's Pjorgful, like prideful.\" Is it important to them to be anti-intellectual? \"You would think, but that's kind of a prejudice, in the same way that people are prejudiced against goblins.\" The mysterious disappearance of goblins from the continent remains largely unexplored, although the two-dozen or so here may offer some clues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[1:38]</p>\n<p>Pjorg is now next to the castle, and experiences one more unfortunately event.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fails a DC 14 con save.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The tendrils confused by his immobility make a last ditch attempt, and stab him in his remaining healthy flesh.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jaap feels all the goblins-without-head-tops as latent undead.</p>\n<p>Drav feels as though her mind is being invaded by prohibited arcane magic, but she buries her face in the warm earthy smell of Longcoat's mane, and the grounding that gives her the rocks and land ward off the whispers. (Drav's ultimate fear is that her birth parents and her adoptive parents, don't love her.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some inverse-genii spell that can eradicate love, and she turned paged fast as she could despite how intersted in learning she was; one of few spells she didn't want to learn in depth; and she turned the pages as fast as she could.</p>\n<p>Longcoat nickers comfortingly.</p>\n<p>Around Pelageena erupts a shield ... of fire. after jaap's trickster guardians poke and prod at her with their talons of wisdom or something. And he uses Blessed Strike to do an extra 1d8. They chase her off and bite her, and her speed is halved. And she does 2 concentration checks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pelageena uses that half of her movement to extricate herself from the Spirit Guardians radius. Jaap: \"I'll get her back in.\" (mockingly) \"Where are you going? I'm just a little gnome.\"</p>\n<p>The shadow creature slashes into Flick with ice-cold talons and screams loudly and theatrically.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CON SAVE DC 15 Jaap and Flic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap is deaf for one minute, and Flick.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick's speed is reduced by 20 feet until the start of her next turn.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap is getting dangerously close to this Brain Ooze, but it still manages to course its way slowly towards him.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ooze fails the wisdom saving throw on spirit guardians. and takes 12 damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ooze snakes a pseudopod up on either side of Jaap, leaving trailing bits of dark orange goo on his plate armor.</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc-Bear sniffs the air again. There are nauseating and corpselike smells coming from the tower area. Lower down he smells sludge, and newborn animals (placental blood or goo). Elsewhere in the building is a human scent coming from the far-back right. He knows there are servants quarters. He can also detect that there are drafts coming in from wood-panelled areas next to the room (Secret passages?).</p>\n<p>JLB blows the door open with his bear strength, and sees in the corner a staircase, and above him in the corner closest to him is water collecting on the ceiling and dripping down. There are drips throughout the wall next to him and into the middle of the room; they smell like rotten eggs and vinegar. He can see symbols carved into the underside of the stone stairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DEX save KH DC 15 CON. fail. JLB uses point of inspiration.</p>\n<p>12 force damage&nbsp;Slashing at the glyph with his claws severs some invisible container, and a concussive wave smashes him across the room, his claws digging into the soft wood floor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He lets out a loud roar, which Vengeance hears in his swampy egg room. A new sort of scream-based audition must be taking place. A bit of Jean-Luc's smooth natural voice comes through, and the roars are oddly melodic.</p>\n<p>Vengeance, as he stands next to the cocoons, the one he pulled the cat out of has collapsed; the other, with a body inside, inches its tendrils forwards.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>19 to hit for 5 slashing damage&nbsp;Breathing life into the wet and sticky cat's body, he's taken unawares when sharp serrated thorns on the tendril slash into his leg, opening up lacerations which immediately puff up in angry red welts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance is confirmed in his belief that these are the pinatas used at the monastery, because this sort of thing would happen once in a while. You'd either get a reward or a punishment. He also recalls one weird instance where, as a tendril snuck out of a cocoon, he noticed a triangle of bright golden light appear next to him and slice off the tendril. He looked around, and it seemed as though Yngvildr, giving him a wink, had somehow conjured this into being, but he was secretly feuding with Yngvildr so consciously disregarded this act of concern. He didn't give it any more thought at the time, but now, thinking back on it, his feud in part had been because Yngvildr always proved far more incompetent than he, a 'virtue' which he could never forgive, and that alone would have precluded her from such an act of kindness. Maybe this shining golden light ... emerged from him? In either case, he would never cease to hate Yngvildr; a hate, however, which would itself never eclipse that he held for Schlonzel; and&nbsp;that&nbsp;hatred magnified by the similarity between the texture of the cocoons and Schlonzel's repulsive skin.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flick moves without provoking opportunity attacks. First weapon attack of the round has advantage. and hits 23 force damage.&nbsp;[]&nbsp;She passes her con check, but is bloodied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>_The blood seeping from the glyphs on the wall begins to collect quicker, falling now in coursing rivulets down the joints of the stone wall.</p>\n<p>\"I'm finally getting through to you you awful, awful woman\" Flick shouts, though, being temporarily deafened, without being able to hear anything, picking her way over into Jaap's spirit umbrella. The badger 'clearly approves' of Flick, who fires another arrow at the woman as her inner fire burns brightly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12 piercing (after halved) and passes a CON check.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[]</p>\n<p>Flick eyes the shadow, who, despite Flick's aeolian extrication, nearly caught her in its black feathery claws, and decides not to risk adjacency for the moment and drops into a defensive crouch. (Flick used to think the Ethereal Plane was a nice friendly place that helped her, but she's going to have to rethink that.)</p>\n<p>Vengeance, meanwhile, sees the cocoon has drawn the sliver of flesh from his thigh back into itself and appears to be macerating it in a leafy well glistening with a lime green liquid. He's cradling the cat's pumpkin-sized head on his lap as it purrs wetly. Having heard all the scream auditions, he picks up the ungainly feline and hoists it over his shoulder, \"I know you were just born, and your ears haven't been properly cleaned, but we just have to get to this audition, there's no time.\" As he rushes away, he can see the last cocoon, enlivened by consuming his flesh, slashing into him again with its sawtoothed tendrils. He makes his way to the third floor a black void, out of which emerges wafts of freezing air and freakish whispers like those he used to hear emanating from the monastery's lavatories. He's so swift that he bursts through the sphere while the shards of souls are swatted away by the loudly mewing cat. He puts down the cat and prepares to perform his audition.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Insight 17</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vengeance has never seen Tishara \"not in costume,\" but suspects that the woman in the tower now (actually Pelageena) is not Tishara but Tishara's body double, dressed in Tishara's costume with blood and gore makeup on (probably too intricate to put on someone during a scene change) so thinks that maybe the person he should be auditioning for isn't in the room, but this could be someone he has to beat in an audition, if they are already an understudy. He believes Tishara is watching from a secret hiding spot. He jumps in, and to the body double, says, \"Well, it looks like we're going to be scene partners. I'm sorry we don't have time to get to know each other. I think this is going to be great, just follow my lead.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Performance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She keeps her back to Vengeance and continues on. It's clearly a snub. \"Well, fine, I guess it's just going to be me and the cat.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pjorg is still outside the manor house. He rushes through the bear-door / doggy door. He sees that the door to his left is exploded open, and sees dust and hair swirling in gusts in that room. Spiral Stone staircase enclosed within a column of stone. To his left is the werebear that JL has become, having just suffered an impact-resist-slide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>STR save KH. nat 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are runes carved into the staircase for PulseWave, and the bear claw marks through them activated the glyphs and it's now spent. Pjorg goes up the stairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does Pjorg have an interest in learning glyphs? He thinks so, but not in the middle of a massive world-ending thing that has been quickly killing Pjorg. If he comes back here and the staircase still exists, he could probably pick this ward up. Pjorg is not the kind of a learner where he can learn really quickly. He may have to do a lot of adjunctive punching.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drav continues towards the mansion.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DEX saving throw KH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She sees huge black orbs thunder into the ground ahead of her, Longcoat unable to avoid the explosions of anti-magic spheres. Drav drags Longcoat the 40 feet (nat 20) using an insane reservoir of strength for wounded animals, she pulls herself and longcoat outside the radius of the sphere. And with a nat 19 she stabilizes Longcoat so she's unconsious but stable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Why wasn't Roxfallanah better?\" Vengeance thinks to himself suddenly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drav pours a healing potion down her throat, and she rouses herself, bruised all over but ok. \"You deserve a rest, buddy\" and slaps her on the flanks to go back to the stables. Longcoat bolts southwest.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gnomes are impulsive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jaap casts cure wounds on Flick at 3rd level. Where is Jaap's spirit weapon?</p>"}

Eldar, Amalia, and Vek put in an appearance as noncombatants.</div>\n<div><hr /></div>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<div>Flick and Jean-Luc drop into the room. Flick continues towards the rest of the group on the far side near the remaining rubble. Jean-Luc sees a regular wooden door which looks out of place in this stone tunnel. As he inspects it, he can see light coming from underneath. [wis 4] Intrigued, the plausibly dashing rogue incautiously shoulders open the thick door and walks in. Since fleeing from Kriobolis after \"getting involved with the wrong woman\" and, more recently, being adopted by a rag-tag collection of @JournalEntry[wxB0U0c3EX2bKcfE]{Goop Snoopers}, this little bit of apparent city life calls out to Jean-Luc warmly. Inside, a small dive bar greets him, empty of occupants except for a single beautiful woman profiled against the ambient light, nursing a beer. She sports close-cropped dark-green hair, a tiny nose that looks slightly broken and wears a well-fitting doublet and trousers set off by a bright white fizzlesilk ascot tied loosely about her neck. [insight 12] He knows her instantly: Marjorie. The honeypot. He'd bought drinks for her all night at @JournalEntry[yBvG1RLG3h4niBWA]{The Shady Sill} until, upon going to pay, discovered his purse has been sliced and the contents removed by, presumably, thieves. Calling out the bartender for providing an unsafe drinking environment had gotten him nowhere. Marjorie had offered to settle everything, but instead somehow indebted him to the Gaol Maidens, a crime ring centered on Kriobolis but with cells all over Albland.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Seeing her here is a relief, although admittedly a freak chance, after bivouacking through the wilderness for days and receiving skin treatments even more dubious than ones he'd had to pass off on unsuspecting tourists (he'd started pretty low on the career ladder with the Maidens). This slice of familiarity feels just right.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Out of the corner of her ear, Flick, hearing Jean-Luc's footfalls turn off to the right, glances back to see the open door and a mildly sickening greenish-yellow light spilling from the room. A \"Hey, friend, you alright?\" gives Jean-Luc a slight pause as to the advisability of this detour, but he successfully compartmentalizes the warning and approaches Marjorie.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Oh Jean-Luc, I also never thought I'd see you again.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: If I recall correctly, I believe you owe me a drink</div>\n<div>Marjorie: How do you figure?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Well the last drink was on me and it ended up costing me my entire money purse.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I thought we'd discovered that was a rowdy bar patron who'd taken advantage of you. (She winks)</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc laughs: I suppose we should let bygones be bygones. A round, barkeep!</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I think you've already got one.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc looks down to see that, indeed, a beer is waiting for him on the counter. Meanwhile, Flick, weirded out, gets into a squat, grunts, and bears down: a sign to the others that she's casting her 'horizonal gaze' towards potential fiends or monstrosities within five miles. But she doesn't sense any nearby. Jean-Luc [nature 20], confident that the beer is beer, gulps down a thiccc slice.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I've been wondering why I never saw you again after you joined the group. I was hoping you'd come back and rescue me.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: I wanted to come back, but I had a falling out with the Maidens. I really did mean to. It got dangerous.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Things were dangerous for me as well. (She removes the white scarf from her neck, which is slit open to the spine.) I wish that you'd been able to protect me from him! (She points to the back corner, where a thuggish man awaits.) That trick I played on you didn't always go over as well; one time he did get violent before I could bring him back to the crew.</div>\n<div>Marcus: Is this one of the guys that tried to rip me off?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Meanwhile, still out in the larger room, Flick's pants fall down as, forgetting to cinch her belt cord after using it to illustrate a particularly sophisticated and boring concept pertaining to the quasi-geometric topology of planar travel [initiative 6] she tries to nod to Carlos that something's up in the 'bar' and, having tied her belt cord to the bowstring in her frantic haste, almost snaps her bow.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc, with grief, anger, and the general sense that something's not right here, charges Marcus. Marcus, exemplifying for Jean-Luc all the evils of urbanity, and swirling with a constellation of reminders of that criminally fraught life, goes dagger-to-Lydia (Jean-Luc's sword) and sustains a confident swipe to the arm.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marcus: We're all just the same to you, aren't we? Someone to take advantage of? Well, I'll show you how unique I am. (Reaching behind his head, he rips his face. Off. The skin, which was healthy, peels away to reveal grey and white rotting flesh suppurating with grey pus and rippling with maggots.)</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Well, this is par for the course, though gross.</div>\n<div>Marcus: I didn't say I was gross, I said I was unique. Why, what are you seeing?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: Just another nightmare I'll need to drink away.</div>\n<div>Marcus: I wouldn't trust the beer here. Your bartenders put sleeping potions in it sometimes.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>For just a moment Jean-Luc is overtaken by fear: his very organs tremble at the idea that this creature is getting closer. Somehow the presence of Marjorie gives him courage, or bravado, it's hard for him to know. Fittingly, Marcus runs behind the bar and attempts to hide.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez, stepping light in his Hedge-approved footwear, scurries into the bar and, from his privileged tiny tiny angle very close to the ground, sees the putrid reflection of Marcus in the lacquered and well-polished walls. He strides phlegmatically up to the bar, climbs laboriously onto a barstool (smiling insouciantly all the while), and whips to either side of the zombielike creature to keep him petrified in place.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marcus: Ah, this crew is using whips now? How fancypants.</div>\n<div>Fez: I'm always looking for a new enemy to face.</div>\n<div>Marcus: I see what you did. But it seems a bit annoying if you're just an outsider who comes in to kill \"new\" people.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus [int 16], taking a moment to orient himself to the secret resonances of the Whispering Walls, wheezes into a nearby stone, \"Fellas, fellas, let's ... let's not fight. Can't you see this ghost is tearing us apart. I feel like this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship if we drop our arms and bring it in for a nice hug.\"</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Which ghost is he talking about?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus [performance 6] sprints up behind Marjorie, shouts \"You! You're the ghost!\" and then gently holds his hands up beside her face, delivers \"Fellas fellas stop fighting. It's not worth it\" in an unconvincing falsetto. Marcus asks, \"Is that really the pitch of your voice?\" Not to be dissuaded, Hieronymus continues, \"Jean-Luc, if you agree to put down your weapon and not fight anymore I'll give you a nice smoooooch!\" Jean-Luc, utterly baffled by this conflicting evidence, freezes due to indecisiveness. At the same time a shout is heard from the sub-basement.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Hieronymus, are you attempting to mess with someone's head, as you messed with mine, in pushing it under the lake?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Begone, vile creature!</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Yes, that is very familiar to what you said to me last time.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Uh, no, we ended on good terms.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Do you mean 10 seconds ago, when I was turned, or 10 minutes ago, when I emerged wet and sopping from the lake?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Every time we've seen each other our interactions have been great. So there's no need to bring up the past.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Once I get up there, I will dispute with you as is our custom in the monastery.</div>\n<div>Flick: Is this the one you killed?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Welllllll, she thinks I did.</div>\n<div>Flick: So you're the top line on the shitty monastery people list.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Pretty much everybody from my monastery was shitty.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Yes, I remember Germ&ouml;trid used to sit on the frogs to demonstrate how much weight she was gaining, and she would measure it by the number of frogs she could kill merely by squatting on them.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Yes, I actually liked her. She was one of the good ones. And we had delicious frog dinners in those days.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: What else did you like about her?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: She was cool because she didn't go around drowning and blaming me for it. That's something that I really dislike in a person.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: It's ironic because you would often comment on how you loved it when the bottom of the monk's cassocks would become wettened, and you could see it stick to their spindly little legs.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: Yes, who doesn't like that?</div>\n<div>Rotrude: You said it reminded you of your parents when they went wading for clams or mussels.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Heironymus, shouting \"Oh Nooooooooo!\" makes to leave the room to search for Rotrude.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Carlos glances over at Amalia shadow-boxing with a potential adversary and, grumbling \"Go go hammer,\" covers the undead dwarf with the spiritual hammer and makes his way into the bar, nudging the unconscious Drav to rouse her. Rotrude, hearing 'Bruce' spoken from above, asks, \"Did someone mention Bruce? You should ask Hieronymus about a Bruce.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez: I don't think anyone wants to poke that bear.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Jean-Luc, why are you letting this strange-smelling, inappropriately hairy monk manipulate me like this? (and in so doing casts Vengeful Glare)</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>At first, Jean-Luc feels terrified, but then remembers that she was one of the first people who tricked him, and reconsiders their entire relationship history in this context. In the other room, Amalia remains hunched up in the corner. Flick, having recovered herself after tripping on a loose stone spur, smirks towards Jean-Luc and asks if he needs any help. Jean-Luc, visibly reeling, welcomes with a nod this offer of assistance.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marcus: You sure keep a varied crew, don't you. I was expecting a bunch of rabscrabble humans, but this is quite unusual.</div>\n<div>Flick: Rabscrabble?</div>\n<div>Marcus: Yeah, that's a word in Kriobolis.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick, able to focus on the slash in Marjorie's neck, sends a javelin of force energy into the woman.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Clearly my accusatory gaze isn't enough for you, Jean-Luc. When you abandoned me before, it caused my death: how can you not defend me now that I'm back?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: I assumed that you would be able to take care of yourself. (Though he's heard of revenants before, Marjorie appears to have a different agenda than most revenants. Nevertheless, feelings of guilt persist for him.) Put her down, Hieronymus!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc runs over to the bar, parkours against Hieronymus's face and a barstool, does a front-tuck and comes down with Lydia into Marcus, dinking him slightly as Marcus defends himself with his dagger. Jean-Luc, shouting \"I guess I should attack this guy. Don't worry, I won't fail you this time!\" gets begrudging respect from the gruff-speaking throat-slitter for his gymnastic performance.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marcus: I <em>thought</em> you scumbags were working together. I do seem to have painted myself into a corner here, though. I've bet you've never done a good thing in your life.</div>\n<div>Flick: Our plans may not have the results we want, but we're not evil.</div>\n<div>Marcus: You certainly look like a group that has a <em>plan</em> well in hand. I've walked twelve dogs simultaneously with more of a plan.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: Finally, a real rescue attempt!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav awakens to find her friends running into this newly apparent pub; rushing up and into the room she's confronted with the rotting visage of Marcus across the bar and a strange woman with her throat slit and pointed towards Jean-Luc. Fez again arcs his whip over the bar, slashing at the until-recently-unbuttoned sea-abyss-boiled leather armor of Marcus. Hieronymus, still wobbly from Jean-Luc's padded kick to his face, crawls, weeping shamefacedly, around the far end of the bar. \"I can't believe my best friend would be so careless as to kick me in the face.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: There is no possible world in which I am your best friend. What about that mule you keep fucking?</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: She's more of a confidant.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus attacks from the ground with his quarterstaff, making his way up the zomboid's body with each strike, finally landing one in the groin that doubles him over. Our monk then forgoes an unarmed strike in order to attempt a jig on the bar, but slips on putrid flesh and falls back on his butt. His foot brushes up gently against Marcus's face, reminding him for a moment of Rotrude's antediluvian face.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marcus: You're not as good on your feet as this buttoned-up dandy next to me.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus is reminded of the briny marsh area near the lake where he used to go with Roxfallanah to reminisce about his odiferous family. He would cover his beloved mule with stinky mud and bring her back to the monastery to annoy everyone; like a cow, once brought up the stairs she couldn't go back down. She would remain where she was until a barn elevator was built to bring her down.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Carlos, casting his eye on the two undead, for some reason doesn't believe Marjorie to be susceptible to Turn Undead. He calls down Sacred Flame on Marcus. Drav causes the far end of the bar to explode in shrapnel; Jean-Luc, still seeking to prove his worth, pulls a drink tray from under the bar and flips it in front of Marjorie's face, but it passes her too early to provide any cover.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie crawls across the bar to take out her rage on Jean-Luc. She smashes him with one of her calloused and workpersonlike fists. \"Taking my fate in my own ... HANDS ... energizes me,\" and she appears to heal the hole in her throat. Flick takes a cue from this fist and launches one of her own, as force, at Marcus, who shakes his head, \"Almost an honorable fistfight!\" The next arrow, a wooden one, reams a substantial hole in the zomboid's head as he collapses into a greenish salivary puddle. Marjorie and Flick have a dispute regarding their relationship to Jean-Luc.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc finally realizes that, no matter what \"Marjorie\" may be, it's not the historical and sociopersonal figure he's familiar with; no doubt feeling bad about it, he attacks her.</div>\n<div>Marjorie: I knew you'd come after me brutally like this.</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc: YOU'RE NOT MARJORIE!</div>\n<div>Marjorie: You wish to take away my identity as well? ...I suppose this is a bit my fault. I've let myself get trapped by three feisty incels. I still think you should back off tho.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As a gesture of goodwill (?) Hieronymus produces from his satchel a few flat round stones and massage oil, scooping some of Marcus's gluids into the ointment (a magical secretion of Roxfallanah's anal sacs) and rubs into Jean-Lucs shoulders the healing unguent. \"I hope that you'll remember this when the time comes to repay the favor,\" moans Hieronymous cringingly. Jean-Luc shudders to himself at the thought of what that might entail. Marjorie blasts Jean-Luc with an accusation of selfishness for keeping to himself the renewed vigor, at which Jean-Luc, really leaning into the incel thing, screams at her to shut up.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: I would have attacked her but I'm afraid of her banter.</div>\n<div>Rotrude (from the floor below): I did always love our banter, and I do not know why you're being self-deprecating right now.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: I'm going to banter you in the face!</div>\n<div>Rotrude: See, I love this.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Eldar</h2>\n<div>Drav, shooting a firebolt, misses, being distracted by the sight of a small child crouching under the table to her right. Edging behind Carlos, Drav makes eye-contact with the child and motions towards Marjorie. \"Is this bad woman trying to hurt you?\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\"Drav, is that you? What are you doing up there? You're going to get hurt!\" Drav suddenly has a vague memory of this child: with her elf parents, she had to hide from them this part of her life. She had an imaginary friend that she knew she wasn't supposed to tell anyone about. It seems as though they've returned to her. Her name was Eldar, and Drav would get into scrapes exploring the woods, or sneaking into her parents' library to read books she wasn't supposed to. Eldar, though, looks frightened. [investigation 9] The table's shadow is obscuring her physiognomy too much to determine how 'alive' she is.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav crawls closer to the figure under the table, who whispers, \"We were just here a few moments ago. You stood up and started throwing all sorts of terrifying magic around.\"</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav: I was just under _here_?</div>\n<div>Eldar: Yeah, we were just under here playing.</div>\n<div>Drav: Have I grown up?</div>\n<div>Eldar: You've always changed a little differently than I have. I can still see that you're Drav; it doesn't matter that you look like an older dwarf now.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Drav moves close enough to touch the child; Carlos attempts to pull Drav backwards, but Drav slips out of his hands and makes it fully under the table. [insight 12] However real Drav knew that Eldar was when they were children, she seems to be more so now, despite being somewhat translucent. It seems enough unlike the \"undead goop monsters\" to stay close.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Eldar: I think we can sneak out the door and go exploring again!</div>\n<div>Drav: Yes, let's be very quiet and play hide-and-seek, and keep an eye out.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Eldar, whispering \"I think we should play tag instead,\" reaches out to touch Drav; where the wizard is touched, the flesh begins to wither away. Drav scrambles backwards as Eldar teases \"You're it!\" and bolts through the solid stone wall.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>Shoemaker Byte, Vek</h2>\n<div>Given the opportunity, Drav quickly scans the undersides of the other tables in the bar; seeing nothing, she stands up, only to notice a large glass jar containing loosely packed black soil on top of the table she was just under. [arcana 18] She hears a voice in her head: \"Tell Flick that the Shoemaker is here.\" Drav conveys the message to Flick, who recalls that Onfalon had spoken of a 'protector of the forest' Shoemaker Byte, rumored to be a spiritualist who kept spiritual entities in the basement of their creepy mansion; people would come to supplicate themselves and act as vessels for the spirits who would enter and provide drug-like experiences.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\"I told you this was a trap!\" Carlos intones, casting healing word. \"There's dirty dirty undeads everywhere!\" \"I should have listened to you, my wise elder,\" Drav responds. \"But Drav what's wrong with a little dirty now and then?\" Eldar shouts from her invisible location. Carlos, an imposing force for good, continues harboring her religious potential.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: You're slimy in your fighting as well as your life. Let me get a good punch in on you! --And you just see me as a meat puppet, do you? I like to make relationships with people, even the ones I'm going to rip off.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Flick unleashes another volley, gives a slightly paranoid glance to the table under which the child appeared, and asks Drav, \"Is that someone you know?\"</div>\n<div>Drav: It took the form of an imaginary friend I had in my youth, but it never did that.</div>\n<div>Flick: I should hope not.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Behind Drav, Flick sees a huge hulking figure step through the door: a bear twice the height of a human: Shoemaker Byte! She wears an iron kettle upside-down on her head and holds out a double-pawful of goodberries. \"Did you think these were coming out of thin air?\" [wis 6] Flick all of a sudden perceives the innate flammability of the wood in the bar, finding herself overtaken by the urge to make sure none of it sets on fire. The bear walks to the table next to Drav and smashes into the piece of furniture with a massive woodcutter's axe, shouting, \"this is all kindling! Make sure you get rid of it!\" and pushes Flick towards another one of the tables.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: What regrets do you have about me? I have regrets: That I ever knew you; that I got in with this crew; that I went after Marcus.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Fez tries to whip off her head, as Hieronymus whips himself into a clunky pirouette, punching and swinging during the apogee of his revolutions until his last blow lands.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Marjorie: That's a lot of sound and fury.</div>\n<div>Hieronymus: I might give it another whirl.</div>\n<div>Rotrude: Don't let him whirl you! It's another name for a swirly!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Carlos tries to <em>Command</em> Eldar, who, unaffected, giggles and runs further down the stairs. Inside the bar, Shoemaker is carrying the jar of soil. Drav launches a bolt of fire from her hands, igniting Marjorie's scarf and singeing some of her undead pluripotent stem cells. She tries to bring down Jean-Luc as a metonym for the crime syndicate. Flick, staring daggers at Drav for setting something aflame, takes a dampened misty step, fires a slug at Drav (who gets knocked prone), puts a mortal arrow through Marjorie (\"Jean-Luc, once again you leave me mur-dered!\" Heironymus claps him on the back, \"You sure know how to pick 'em, buddy\". Rotrude shouts, \"You sure had your share of pathetic girlfriends in your day as well. And you never wanted me to tell anyone, but that time you cheated on Roxfallanah.\" Hieronymus responds, \"Hey, why don't you try being Rote-nice for once, instead of Rote-rude.\" to which she says, \"I would have said Rote-kind \"), and pushes a table slightly closer to an outside wall of the bar, away from Drav. After this, Flick drops to the ground and rolls around to extinguish any possible flames on her person.&nbsp;</div>"}

After Paros declares that it can detect his psychic presence from at least two miles away, everyone panics deliberatively. Startrella offers his 'pad' on Si'A as a refuge, but the teleportation spell requires to zap them there would leave a few people behind. Some contemplate standing their ground, but in the end Drav twists the very Laws of Magic to magnify Roxfallanah to the size of a cloud giant and they gallop away, secure in the knowledge that their Passage is Without Trace, but of two minds that Paros kept one of the circlets. From a safe distance they survey the vacated clearing and see tentacles issue from the robot, grab the boxes of tiaras, and dump them into a cargo vault on its back.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Transcript</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Printing Presses: definitely printing presses, but no gunpowder. The printing presses are just for making packing newspapers with lorem ipsum text on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gluggranok is still trying to get into one of the crates. Drav [Investigates 13] the crates as Glugg tries to interpose his body in between. Drav [Athletics 26], trying to gently move him out of the way, but misjudges her own strength and pushes him face-first onto the ground. He's pulled out huge armfulls of bast and old shredded newspapers, and Drav sees more of the reddish-gold caps spilling out. Drav shouts, \"There are more of those mind-control things in here!\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rovlar: Get away from Gluggranok! Move away from those crates!</p>\n<p>Mule wanders over to the cabin and edges the door open and begins to walk inside the cabin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Flick) Vengeance, go get your friend there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Vengeance) She can handle herself; she's always going off on her own little mini quests.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>????????????</p>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Paros has real world experience with horses. Because, you know, his parents get around on horses and there were horses in the village. Once village horse, Scutterball, loved wild strawberries, which he then noticed with other horses. He sees now that Mule has ignored a large bush of wild strawberries in order to push her head into the cabin. (Vengeance might have fed her three days ago.)</p>\n<p>Rovlar notices Drav going into the crates and, \"I'm quite serious, I'm going to have to let loose on you.\" Drav, though, casts shield on herself. For a brief moment, a shining light of armor appears around her and deflects the arrow away. Eldar: \"Together we can keep them from hurting us.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Startrella): is there anything you need me to do, here? I'm still on a buzz, but &hellip;</li>\n<li>(Jean-Luc): No, enjoy your buzz, we have things pretty much locked down here.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Vengeance, suddently becoming aware of the strange behavior of Mule, harnesses his ki to cover over 100 feet in six seconds (sprinting about 15 miles an hour) -- Roxfallanah, what are you doing? -- Mnnaannannnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaa -- Oh, ok, carry on. [Perception] You can see through the door that there's a shape of a humanoid figure lying on the ground face-up; they have a very large cloak, or wings spread out on the ground behind them. It looks like the thing could be made of stone. -- There could be a cockroach in there, Roxfallanah, and I do know how you hate bugs :: This causes Roxfallanah to back up, and she turns to the strawberries. -- (sotto voce) She did say she wanted to do a juice cleanse. -- (psychic) .. it was actually a juice smoothy .. :: in one of the rare moments, Vengeance thinks, that Roxfallanah manages to get through to him. Having gotten Roxfallanah out of the doorway, Vengeance walks into the cottage; he's able to see that the figure is totally stone laid out on the ground, fairly symmetrically, and that (which he would have learned at the monastery, studying angels and demons) this is an Aasimar. Cottage otherwise has crude bed and table and chair. There is no weapon observable, but their clothing is stone, like their body. -- What a lucky soul, I wish I could petrify myself. :: The distinct sound of a very large eagle carrying a very large frog is audible.</p>\n<p>Carlos heals Flick and then swings his war axe at Glugg, who, despite getting slashed, remains tethered to the mortal plane.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Rovlar): If you all could kill Glugg and bury him</li>\n<li>(Jean-Luc): Doesn't Glugg seem oddly defensive of these helmets despite not wearing one?</li>\n<li>(Paros): guys you too can do really well at stuff if you go insane.</li>\n<li>(Veenock): No, Paros, you're definitely the most sane one here.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc and Paros see, about two miles north, a huge figure moving very quickly. At 30 feet tall, it's approaching at the speed of a galloping horse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Paros): Is it a really big galloping horse?</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>It's more like a tower with three rotating legs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Paros): I hope the martians haven't come to invade. :: He can feel that there's something on or nearby that knows that he is an intelligent creature, and Paros's Third Eye starts throbbing (mental version of hair on the back of his neck standing up). Paros, completely distracted from everything else going on, feels drawn towards it an apprehensive.</li>\n<li>(Veenock): Hey, baby, why feel anxious. I just told you you were the sanest one here. Doesn't that give you a nice flow?</li>\n<li>(Paros): Ok well then I guess it's fine.</li>\n<li>(Veenock): Hey, whatever keeps you calm. Although I like it when you're worked up as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Paros tries to ignore Veenock for a minute while the figure approaches. Again, Paros's knowledge of horses comes into play and he judges its arrival in about 5 minutes. He alerts the rest of the party. Flick attempts to focus her elf eyes. Udrek, they see, has slowed down to a light jog, which is still a fast pace due to Haste but is no longer a sprint. Drav's sensitive dwarf ears pick up Udrek shouting -- Master. General. Coming?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(Rovlar): Now you guys are screwed. I suggest getting the hell out of here if you want to keep your lives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Flick): We don't know the meaning of the word.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Jean-Luc): Yeah, we fight things we shouldn't all the time. This is just another Tuesday.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Rovlar): You guys have real trouble with hobgoblin words, don't you. This isn't the first time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Flick): I can't wait to knock this schtick out of the tree.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): You're gonna get him this time, I know it Paros. Tune out the haters. This is Paros's \"me\" decade. This is gonna be fall-down-fight-o-nomics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): Hold on does somebody have a sweet tip? Did I hear someone talking about investments?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Paros): Veenock how are you talking to Flick?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): Well you'd have to talk to him for me. Or work something out with Startrella? The tip might go stale!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>[Paros is not sure if Veenock hears everything that Paros hears.]</p>\n<p>[A discussion of Dexter's Dark Passenger.]</p>\n<p>Flick's worst fears come true as Cyrowan gets within 20 feet of Fez. --Don't worry my lord I'm coming! We're gonna get you all dried off and build a fire for you. And get you out of this emotional basement, so I can live there! :: Joan hears the rumbling of the tripod. -- Is it against the law to do studying around here?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Cyrowan): As far as I'm concerned there's only the law of protecting your master: the law of the feudal chain of command. Also the Great Chain of Being.</li>\n<li>(Startrella): There's also the Law of Cool.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Jean-Luc moves towards the trees and Hides so as to more effectively assassinate. Rovlar doesn't perceive you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Rovlar): What'd you do, duck down over there? Pause for a second. Did you whisper something?? I could see you, and then I couldn't see you. A equals not stealth A. Proceed to three-quarters cover, that's the only way you'll defeat me.</li>\n<li>(Flick): i love the reverse pscyhology.</li>\n<li>(Rovlar): no this is regular psychology.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Drav stomps on Glugg's outreached hand. The hobgoblin reaches out with plaintive eyes; a pitiful hobgolin staring back at her from the ground. Drav, a little worried about Eldar's position on all this, doen't hear anything from her 'imaginary friend'. Flick shoots \"normal\" arrows through a break in the branches.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(Rovlar): you'd be at a tactical advantage if you shot wildly and scared your targets, rather than appearing cold and scientific. It's a tactical advantage to keep your enemies alive, actually! ::Flick listens for a few seconds and fires again: the arrow goes through her \"left shoulder\" and she spins around. Jean-Luc sees that the arrow goes right through Rovlar's eye, and then her body falls off the arrow; Flick believes that the fall is what kills her.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Flick): Drav, I have a piece of Startrella that can cast teleportation circle, but I don't know any destination sigils. But you and Paros read like crazy. Or we can stand and fight whatever's coming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Drav): it seems really ominous.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Flick): if it's going 20 miles an hour, we could cast the teleportation spell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Startrella): you can always come back to my pad, you know. There's Elka, where I went through my larval stage. It's a giant ocean teeming with poison. There's Geynor, where I went through my reproductive stage. You're not gonna like that for pretty much cosmetic reasons. There's Si'a though. I should have started with that one because that is where my pad is. There are some humanoids that have to live in bubble cities. and they make do, and they can pretty much turn the wholle place into a giant hot box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Jean-Luc): as far as whether or not fighting is a bad idea; i think we could take it in a fight. we punch above our weight class.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Drav): It seems to be moving pretty fast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Paros): We also have the power of friendship.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock) don't forget the power of intense rivalry. and grudges. and deep-seated enmity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Paros): those are good too. wait -- are you suggesting I should have a grudge against this thing?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): look, if you want me to give you advice, you're going to make sure i get some stock tip advice. we could do a quid pro quo or something like that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Paros): Ok, so &hellip; buy high and sell low or whatever.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): i sort of meant specific insider-trading level information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Paros): the insider is YOU, Veenock</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Jean-Luc): we should tell him to short that distillery &hellip; company &hellip;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): short Tepplin you say? I thought they were up and coming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Jean-Luc): Not anymore &hellip;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Veenock): i'm gonna talk to some of my floor traders. and seriously, that thing coming towards you has something inside of it: the sweet nougaty insides; although the thing on the outside is a threat in and of itself. also can you ask startrella for some of that fizzlecoke?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Drav [Arcana 21] knows that teleportation circles are a very specific kind of magic. She does know one in the Steeplepeak Mountains, east of her adoptive homelands of Forest Ogrelodge. The problem is, they are already fairly close to their destination; it's kind of agricultural. there is organization going on around a bay to the southeast . there's one that she's heard about, on one of the islands. But she casts her mind back, and she sees that the fire of the cart has consumed the cart almost entirely; the ashes are still warm, and it looks like they are providing heat to these shards, that before may have blended in with the glass. Light-blue shards; it's the sort of crystalline or glass used to trap something or keep something inside of it. and it has exploded. to keep something incorporeal in it. (Was it in the cart?) Drav tries to see if something has been released. [Nat 20] She can sense that this kind of gem is used specifically to trap angels, and that it's been exploded, and that it was killed, or managed to escaped; they are kept trapped against their will; the deva escaped. They are not here anymore; the pattern that's left is one that looks like the deva -- as if reading the flame pattern from a rocket launch -- used this to return to one of the higher spheres. You'd need a connection to the divine to use this weird kind of teleportation circle. [They would need the same kind of technology to travel to and from a celestial teleportation thing of this different nature. They wouldn't be able to travel back unless they found a similar reverse pattern, even if they had the spells to do it. Even regular teleportation circles aren't terribly common.]</p>\n<p>\"Drav the Arcane Queen\". She mentions all this to the party while grabbing a crown to study later. Flick connects the etheral gemstones from the etherial plane with what Drav has just spoken of. Flick: The starchild lifecycle sounds disgusting. (Startrella) Actually you just need to think about it from the perspective of accepting the natural world and the natural cycles and you'll be a little less judgmental. As larva, we can't afford to judge each other , since our lives are so precious, but also so meaningless because 9/10ths of us die before we can take our next form. That's only in part due to the ecology of the world, but also how harsh that particular planet it. I've wondered if it was designed to be that hard to weed out specimens. I haven't achieved the final metamorphosis of brain elder yet, so &hellip; i'm going to leave the contemplation to then. You can really only understand the true name of elder brains by having cosmic background radiation converted into sound waves. i don't have the acoustic equipment . i have this sweet recording studio on Si'a. If you come, I'd love to show you some of this stuff. Just noodle around.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Jean-Luc): there's something to be said for figuring out what's going on with these hobgoblins and the mind controlling helmets; it seems like something we're against on principle.</li>\n<li>(paros): take the portal to bubbleland, right?</li>\n<li>(star): \"take the portal to bubbleland\" is one of my favorite albums</li>\n<li>(vengeance): i feel like if we go back to this pad we're going to have to hear a lot of bad acoustic guitar.</li>\n<li>(star): i'm more worried you won't be able to appreciate the acoustic instruments i can play that you haven't even heard of before. i could try to convey that to you, especially if you were on the right kind of mind-changing substances. this is way cooler than fizzlecoke.</li>\n<li>(paros): do i even want to know?</li>\n<li>(star): that could be kind of dangerous for you, Paros, you're already dealing with three different minds in one.</li>\n<li>(paros): what's wrong with that?</li>\n<li>(star): nothing&hellip;? but you do seem like you move at a nice steady slow pace, so if that were to increase, i don't know if you have the cognitive resources to be able to deal with that.</li>\n<li>(paros): are you trying to say that i'm not mentally up to snuff to handle my fizzlecoke.</li>\n<li>star: that's a good one.

Insofar as I know cults, this is reminiscent of their behavior. i don't think they're really taking political office now and taking kickbacks or owning garbage disposal companies, or even drug dealing. it looks like they're after world domination, i would say.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: wait you heard about that waste management scam too in cressida?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flick: i'd be surprised if it wasn't crooked in any given city.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: wow you mortals are already this jaded? maybe you should try your hand at being an eternal demon. there used to be so many fucking angels on this plane, you couldn't walk a step without somebody drinking a glass of skim milk. just disgusting. who. drinks. milk. it doesn't make any sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>jean-luc: let's figure out what we're dealing with; if we bug out to startrellas and hang out, and then come back and figure out what's eating the gnolls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>paros: we might never come back if we go to Startrellas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: wait do you have leads on the troll-eating thing? oh, i'm sorry, i thought you said troll. nevermind &hellip; nevermind &hellip;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>paros: veenock, why do you care about this?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: i heard \"organized crime\" and i was like \"yeah, count me in.\" i'll tell you right now, though, i've been around a while, i don't know what these caps are. they look like newfangled technology, and i'm used to fire and brimstone and bringing skeletons back to life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>paros: that was definiteyl not cool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: i think you mean very cool. don't you remember how long he could do wall sits ? you don't get quads like that overnight. you should have seen him do armhangs. 3, 4 days</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flick: but skeletons don't weight anything</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: he was also at a 30 degree angle so there was a lot of core strength</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flick: he was a skeleton!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>veenock: exactly, do you know how much strength it takes to hold yourself up without muscles</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>flick: a lot of strength of character</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A discussion ensues. Flick: our best bet is to get 300 feet to the west. jean-luc and i can be forward sentries. my guess is, the people inside the structure &hellip; if they stop, people will have to get out. Paros: they've already noticed me, somehow. if I hide, I shouldn't be hiding with anyone else. (Paros suspects that the telepathic presence can probably detect any intelligent life form, but he didn't feel it until 2 miles so that might be its maximum range.)</p>\n<p>(Have the mule fight the tower -- and turn it into power rangers)</p>\n<p>The decision is made to cast Enlarge/Reduce on Mule three times, and have the mule dash for almost the entire minute. [It is established that Vengeance keeps lizards and snakes inside the saddlebags] Flick goes to sell the plan to Aphelia. \"We're going to &hellip; run on a giant mule away from a mechabeast. Could you let me help you climb this tree to jump on?\" Aphelia begins playing a well-known Mule-travelling song on her dulcimer and looks pretty excited.</p>\n<p>Flick, having some kind of out of body experience, says \"I was worried she was going to be one of those prissy NPCs who are really difficult, but she's a good sport.\"</p>\n<p>Jean-Luc: Someone isn't being difficult if they don't want to ride a giant mule.</p>\n<p>Flick: Even when you're traveling with us?</p>\n<p>Paros: Won't they notice a four-story-tall mule running around?</p>\n<p>Flick: we could also reduce the size of the siege engine. (But if it doesn't willingly submit it can make a CON save)</p>\n<p>[2:10]</p>\n<p>Flick gets up onto the roof, catches Mule's flank, and scrambles into her saddlebag. Flick uses her primeval awareness: \"First of all, thanks very much for being willing to carry us all this way, but it's really important she get us as far away from this thing as possible, and we'll get her all the strawberries she wants\" -- All the wild strawberries? You can make a promise. Can you make sure this fishy man gets away from me? (Flick): That's another kind of action item we're going to have to worry about. (Roxfallanah): Action item? you seem very professional. (Flick) Crisis brings that out of me. We really have to get going. -- And then Mule takes off going 60 or 70 miles an hour, somehow leaving no trace of her passage. (Vengeance): How is she doing this having no calories? (Flick) I'll just give her a goodberry or two: I think that should take care of it.</p>\n<p>[2:40]</p>\n<p>When Mule shrinks to regular height you're lying face-first on the ground holding the strawberry up behind you, and she licks at Vengeance's balding pattern and takes the strawberry. Joan jumps off when Mule is still 40 feet high and only takes 4 damage because of rage. Drav and Jean-Luc fall off at 20 feet and take 10 damage [failing their DC 13 athletics / acrobatics checks]. Startrella, either go big or go home, able to get to Si'a, can't dismount cleverly. Paros and Carlos stay on as Mule shrinks all the way. You are now a mile away from their overnight camp; looking back, they see that the tripod has stopped. Flick [nat 20] can see that it's extended tentacles from itself and its emptying the boxes into a hatch opened in the back of the cabin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(Flick): this is a very sophisticated piece of machinery</li>\n<li>(Jean-Luc): that just means there's more things that can go wrong, like if we just throw a fireball at it</li>\n<li>(Flick): well we can't be tracked for the next 55 minutes, as long as it doesn't have a line of sight on it. Part of me wishes you hadn't taken the hats &hellip;</li>\n<li>(Paros): But I need a hat.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<p>Paros detects that his third eye is kind of sleepy, and it closes its lid.</p>"}

Joan, a true and loyal friend, keeps Drav's memory alive by baptising a chondric mushroom fetus as &lsquo;Dravita&rsquo; so the creature&rsquo;s soul will not be forsaken to the plane of Limbo. Flick&rsquo;s fragile constitution is put to the test as Carlos notices and then eviscerates a squirrel pregnant with the nut-eggs of its own spider-squirrel squipiderlings, which soon follow their parent into the great gooey abyss of death. Equally curious, though far less gruesome, is a tall pole topped with a sparkling trinket. The party&rsquo;s attempts to retrieve the object of interest are thwarted until an exhibition of brute strength by Joan reveals that one of the six classical simple machines (screw threads, which, arguably, are an inclined plane (another simple machine) wrapped around a cylinder) were affixing the pole in the ground. Joan, like a luminous scaly wrench, screws the pole into the ground until she can retrieve the black metallic sphere which sits in a divot at the top. As is becoming her wont, she promptly stuffs it into her backpack, which still drips with Dravita&rsquo;s white ichor.</p>\n<p>As the party continues on their arrow-straight path towards Castle Karn, they hear the active sounds of a village ahead. Flick espies two armed witherlings headed aggressively towards the stead. Moving as quietly as a porcupine in outer space, our intrepid wood elf dismantles one of the creatures with two well-placed arrows and reports back to the party as the other witherling appears to flee. Now on high alert, Flick, Carlos, and Joan approachs what they believe to be the sounds of the village, only to discover that the noises emanate from a grotesque incel-informed parody of a cervid, replete with neckbeard, a propensity for vacuous mimicry, and razor-sharp bone ridges substituting for teeth. Already engaged in battle against the creature are two witherlings and a human sorcerer, Paros. With such concentrated firepower, the monster is soon reduced to a slubbering puddle of flesh, and the witherlings (now, it was clear, a more ontologically sophisticated group than had been originally assumed) point the gang towards the purportedly hospitable and welcoming pale of the gnoll village.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c2f8c73-7fff-62fb-e338-71780689c60e\"></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"ludmillasperski\"></h4>\n<h1 id=\"transcript\">Transcript</h1>\n<p>[n/a]</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>[recording available]</p>\n</section>"}

Jean-Luc knows he's not under the effects of anything; he knows that Lydia is still about 20 feet away</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance still being turned on by Fez's attacks on Mule.</div>\n<br />\n<div>The last Jean-Luc knows is that Lydia is alive. She was the daughter of a merchant and a copper maid? wearing cloth trousers, walking/traveling boots, tunic belted in, hair kept back in a braid, a little dagger at her hip; a utility weapon.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gorph leaves the area of the land which has erupted in Cyrowan's tentacles.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Nem comes to the rescue of K-Flifph, getting advantage through pack tactics</div>\n<br />\n<div>Jean-Luc comes over to Sneak Attack K-Flifph, cleaving, and using K-'s body as cover while cleaving into Nem.</div>\n<div>K-: don't make K stand for kill! we;re the original inhabitants of this place. you're standing on our ancient Burrow-grounds. There didn't use to be a lake here, you know.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Nem: if you go even a step into the lake, you'll see the remains of our Burrow Ground! K-flifph's throat is slit, and on the backswing JL cuts Nem in the ribs.</div>\n<br />\n<div>After K-'s body goes limp, Flick sees that it further deflates after death. flick: so it's an appendage or decoy, rather than a person?</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance: you thought being a cuckold was a bad thing! as he thinks horns sprout from his head, -- in a brief moment of clarity, he knows that thinking he has horns is theatrics. if he wants he can hold his quarterstaff up --- this one time he's able to embrace the performer in him who loves making shitty tunes on his panpipes. or hold four darts out like horns from his forehead. -- he ends up attacking with the quarterstaff and using flurry of blows. he does shake his head, and the leaves fall out of the mitre and he's wearing the branch superstructure. most of running over there, tho, was deciding which of these options to use, and he dropped everything on the way, ending up just using his fists. -- I think you should do somethingn else with your spaghetti hair!</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gorph: This is my body, not spaghetti hair!</div>\n<div>Vengeance: oh, well in that case I apologize. (He can see that gorph's body is blueish green because it's comprised of blue-green algae, of which there are collections growing on the edges of the lake. given the time of year, it should be covering the whole lake. Gorph might be an agglutination of the lake's algae) We should keep it away from the algae?</div>\n<div>Gorph: I'm a cure for what ails you, whatever that be , probably mortality!</div>\n<div>vengeance: so we should be eating you?</div>\n<div>gorph: just the extract, which is emanating from my body</div>\n<div>vengeance: Seems like poison</div>\n<div>gorph: more like mithridatism.</div>\n<div>vengeance: are you sure it's in the right dosage?</div>\n<div>gorph: yes, the air properly homeopathizes it, and i have to ... when I have to deal with being attacked, it's a bit more difficult, so you're probably experiencing side effects</div>\n<div>vengeance: yes, for a minute i was experiencing clarity</div>\n<div>gorph: it's all a side effect, tho, of my Goal to devour your Soul!</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick thinks she's lookingi at gorph, but is really peeking through her fingers. vengeance, you see the red corpuscles on gorph's body, all blink and look mournfully at you when gorph says \"souls\". vengeance: we all have different goals in life; i often make it a point to encourage young monsters like yourself. we're all walking a different path</div>\n<div>gorph: some of us hope to walk infinite paths</div>\n<div>vengeance: isn't 2 or 3 enough?</div>\n<div>gorph: inf [...]</div>\n<div>vengeance: infinitude can even be contained in one path, so you should stick to it</div>\n<div>gorph: i'll stick to taking as many of your souls as I can</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick's head spinning from the physical \"insult\" she took from Nem, she has the presence of mind to try to kill the groundhog. (until this day, the burrowlings were cuddly creatures / neighbors to flick's memory). flick further renders Nem's pelt useless by stabbing with the rapier, spins and tosses her shield away, spins and proceeds towards Gorph, drawing her bow, getting within shooting distance of Gorph</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gorph: this arrow has no character I can detect! it's totally tasteless.</div>\n<br />\n<div>[...]</div>\n<br />\n<div>If flick had been less aware, something would have hit Vengeance while missing Gorph, who is taking Vengeance as a kind of cover? who's able to avoid it by using his monkish reflexes honed by sitting still for hundreds of years in an empty stone room.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Cyrowan looks like he's beginning to absorb the toxic aura, and his head swells and ulcerous nodules begin to form on it -- [insight]Cyrowan looks like he's doing this of his own volition, almost like his head is becoming a brain; the tentacles in the square start to wither and retract; meanwhile gorph's legs are strangled together and he slowly begins levitating in the air, and look restrained.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance: compliments are really going to -- FLick : his head</div>\n<div>Gorph: it looks like i was wrong about which of the old spells have an effect on me.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Fez had done so much trauma to Mule's legs that when she goes to kick back out at her, she misses, and then bucks and runs away from him.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Vengeance: did you lie to me? you said that this poison cloud had homeopathic effects.</div>\n<div>JL: pretty sure he was just talking about killing you</div>\n<div>Gorph: you have to join my body. isn't that homeopathy: you become a single molecule in the infinitude of ...</div>\n<div>Flick: pretty sure it's about water memory</div>\n<div>Gorph: I have poor memories of the water. I ... stay away from it ... for reasons I don't know.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gorph doesn't know its \"eyes\" shift towards Lydia when it says this. -- one of them is a projection of the other, maybe?</div>\n<br />\n<div>Moonbeam, cast by Fez? is on Gorph, and does only half damage . he takes 5 radiant damage.</div>\n<div>Gorph: I'm surprised that a squire like this pledges himself to you, paladin, when he's sort of a metaphysical inverse. can't you see from where his powers derive?</div>\n<div>JL: this might be a two birds with one stone kind of situation. Gorph goes into Cyrowan, but his tentacles are severed, and the head-brain-sac is hanging there empty; like a drunk with excess skin from above the neck hanging down to his knees, and shoulders and arms plunged into the ground.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: see, now that's a hairstyle, Gorph.</div>\n<div>Gorph: i'm closer to getting this one's soul, but I think it will leave a bad taste.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gorph: you're staying far away from my powerful, succulent body.</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL uses bonus action to hide in the rush. JL came from upper middle class, and had formal schooling, so there was a biology unit, but didn't study it in any meaningful way. he's guess that if this were a longstanding lake, but the vegetation looks like it's grown within the last year or six months.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Lydia: Jean-Luc, where'd you go? was this all an illusion? (she doesn't move very far but it looks like she's looking for you.)</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL can hear words probing gently at internal awareness. JL: this doesn't remind me of the Lydia I used to know.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Lydia charms Flick: oh, my elven friend, do you know where Jean-Luc went? Flick doesn't, in fact, see Jean-Luc.</div>\n<div>Lydia: are you talking about the tiny smelly man?</div>\n<div>Flick: no, I'm talking about the eldritch horror suspended above the fish-man and the weird monk.</div>\n<div>Lydia: yes, what once was human and now is a deflated head?</div>\n<div>Flick: he's not my target at the moment.</div>\n<div>Lydia: an Eldritch horror? it seems like you're deeply confused; if you come closer I can apply a mental rememdy. can i ask your name? --Flick: Flicksadei brianniel</div>\n<div>-- I believe I knew that Flicksadei was a common name. she has a deep acquaintance with elven pronunciation. she is an elf of some sort, or had a very long acquaintance with elves.</div>\n<div>Flick: (in elvish) maybe we can talk more later. Lydia begins to respond in elvish, and catches herself. is that another dialect of common?</div>\n<div>Jean-Luc notices this</div>\n<br />\n<div>Cyrowan is still conscious. he has the spines on crab legs poking out of his body. (even if Gorf isn't real, this is happening to him. Vengeance picks up Cyrowan and brings him outside the poison. This isn't any different than the auras that would emanate from the marsh when his parents would drag him out there in the early morning. Vengeance used to fish for hagfish, which release mucus that expands exponentially in water, so this is nothing for him. Vengeance takes a running kick to see if he can punt him? he untethers him from the ground. it moves Cyrowan about a foot, [he imagines this and then \"Next\"'s back in time to just use healing on him. ]</div>\n<div>Cyrowan huffs about helping.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: i don't really remember this boy</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: we met under the temples of xanthuc. your delightful friend rotrude was there. such a good friend. we reminisce about her.</div>\n<div>Vengeance: it kind of sounds familiar. i'm not great with horribly melted faces. i'll fix you right up if you just hold still. i'm going to cut a chunk of your thigh out and graft it onto your face. we used to do this at the monastery for our electices surgeries when we turned 13. you're going to feel right as rain when this is done.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: i can't say it sounds orthodox, but whatever keeps me able to assist master fez. [40 hit points].</div>\n<div>Flick-- you could have... ugh! that would have been so much better spent on me, guys. (waving off lydia)</div>\n<div>Vengeance: you're too far away, sorry, he's right here.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan's face re-inflates . \"Vengeance, a curious restoration this is. we'll have to sing the tales of bravery and heroicism until the end of time, to all who would hear it. in fact, have you ever thought about taking on a squire? no, nevermind, i shouldn't even think of those things.\"</div>\n<div>Vengeane: I don't know if we're really a match. I appreciate the thought.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: i'm eternally in your debt</div>\n<div>Vengeance: that's ok ... i think you looked better before.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: yeah, there was something comely about it.</div>\n<div>vengeance: you'll learn a lot if you stick to me; not too closely, but listen to me.</div>\n<div>Cyrowan: so you -- a two-person mastership.</div>\n<div>flick: challenge him to a dual!</div>\n<div>cyrowan: rotrude was quite adept at throwing down the gaunlet, from her hands</div>\n<div>vengeance: yes</div>\n<div>cyrowan: another trophy of your victories</div>\n<div>vengeance: i WOULD throw it down, i'm just not in the mood right now.</div>\n<div>cyrowan: you should get out of here; over time, though you have a heroic constitution</div>\n<div>vengeance: well said small boy</div>\n<div>cyrowan: we're the same height. i'm human, through and through.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance skips nimbly backwards on his thrush-shoes.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Flick can see the poison cloud boundary</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gorph \"Oof!\" on getting hit . your arrows remind me of the infinite void i can recall living in before i came here.</div>\n<div>as gorf is mouthing off, I bend the second one into his \"soft pallet\" -- my final meal, such a succulent shaft going into my mouth.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick: lydia, what did you just see happen?</div>\n<br />\n<div>she screams and falls unconscious back into the water. she's fully underwater, but it's shallow. no air bubbles are emerging from her mouth or nose. with the lapping of the water, teh ripples make the image of Lydia disappear and she looks like she's sort of comprised of water, and what her boundaries are. now flick can see through the illusion and can tell that it's some other kind of creature. it's her size and humanoid, but it doesn't look -- it looks like an elf made of water.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick knows about Sea Elves, but they aren't made of water like nymphs. they are elves that live next to the sea. like an elf made of jellyfish material.</div>\n<div>[i said no tail here]</div>\n<br />\n<div>she's fallen into shallows; behind her is a deep trench, and then towards the middle of the lake it's shallow. the trench encircles the whole lake.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick casts bestial spirit; see form. sort of looks like a tetrapod water dinosaur. flick wants Gerd to bring up with its fin appendages anything, tell her what it saw down there.</div>\n<br />\n<div>Gerd comes back up to the surface; and dumps onto the bank an animal skeleton; it's waering an arm bracer and very eaten-through leathers. \"what else did you see down there\", \"there were so many skeletons like this, filling the trench. -- you can see the arm bracelet, if I licked it clean\" it's shining, a very dark rock or metal that's glistening. \"a lot of them were wearing this, or things that looked like this in design. this was the most intact skeleton. some of them are blasted to bits; obviously I haven't lived in a lake, even with the small acquaintance with acquatic life, the water down there -- there are very few, there's not a real diversity of life down there.\"</div>\n<div>flick: \"would it affect me?</div>\n<div>gerd: i don't feel any adverse effects besides the oxygen is depleted. maybe a high pH.</div>\n<div>flick: all the decomposing flesh in there.</div>\n<div>gerd: yeah, something like that.</div>\n<br />\n<div>flick examines the body. skeleton looks like an (vengeance) \"probably an armadillo!\" from 50 feet away. flick knows it's probably a small animal skeleton. she goes to pull</div>\n<div>gerd: i can tell his favorite animal is an armadillo because he's definitely into leprosy.</div>\n<br />\n<div>vengeance runs over and attempts to spear gerd to attempt to prove to himself and his father he's a true fisherman. flick notices that when vengeance got a taste of that fish poison, he went a little \"fish crazy\" . he's probably gotten closer by the time flick notices him. flick prepares to do a shove attack with her force arrow. just trying to wound his pride a little bit. -- vengeance has the chance to \"catch\" the missile with a monk ability. vengeance actually deflects the arrow of force, using his qi. but that uses a reaction, so he can only do it once, . in planhage lake, wall runs into you, which is what flick's force arrow feels like. vengeance congratulates himself, deflects a force bolt, and his footwork gets tangled in his thrush boots and he goes head over tumplins.</div>\n<div>why is fishing so hard! he yells. he takes out a tin can on a string from one of JL's beers that he was trying to sell.</div>\n<br />\n<div>\"the real spearing of bestial spirit is the friends we found along the way, neither of which is inside of you\"</div>\n<br />\n<div>Lydia under the water now looks ... like light passes through her distorted.</div>\n<div>when she's out of the water, she's opaque. she looks like a blue elf. her skin is blue, mottled. now that she's out of the water, absene of lines of aging, 5 feet tall, elvish ears. and now that she's entirely out of the water, she has a tail.</div>\n<br />\n<div>how much does JL know about elves? their aren't a lot of them in human cities, but they're not rare in the world. this could be a haute couture elf, or punk rock elf.</div>\n<br />\n<div>- jean-luc: once again some fucking creature has read my mind; my past is filled with horror stories and i don't need to relive them. the curse of leading an interesting life i suppose</div>\n<div>- flick: there aren't too many interesting people in my past.</div>\n<br />\n<div>gerd pulls Lydia 20 feet inland. flick awakens her, and she can't focus her eyes at first.</div>\n<div>- flick: you're seriously outgunned here, friendly acquaintance. just between us friends, Lydia. do you mind telling me what you intended to do with us?</div>\n<div>- Lydia: i wanted to help -- reunite with Jean- what's his name.</div>\n<div>vengeance: Lennon?</div>\n<div>- JL: why Lydia, weird sea creature?</div>\n<br />\n<div>- Gerd: i don't want to go back in the water for now (she points, there's a wave-shaped form with a ghost face hovering about 50 feet from the shore)</div>\n<div>- flick: hey there hi there ho there. thanks for the warning Gred</div>\n<div>- Gerd: it was more for me. i just wanted ot let you know why i was being skittish.</div>\n<br />\n<div>JL: of all the people to impersonate, why her?</div>\n<div>Lydia: when I try to unite with another, it's easier if they are looking for something lost within themselves. when I connected with you and your compansions, yours was the easiest spot to see and try to fill. i've only taken on what you know of this Lydia. they are all just prosthetics to me.</div>\n<div>JL: (sort of understands )</div>\n<div>vengeance: she didn't mean to \"Lydia\" on</div>\n<div>vengeance: has anyone ever told you that you remind them of rotrude?</div>\n<br />\n<div>Rotrude ... the memory is ... maybe? i couldn't tell you where or why. was she a hermit of some kind, a solitary creature? some time ago, i can't claim it was rotrude, but maybe someone of that persuasion -- i'm quite muddled now. do you think you could put me back in the lake, it's very difficult oto be out here on the shore.</div>\n<br />\n<div>- vengeance: me?!</div>\n<div>flick, kneeling next to her, looks out and sees what Gerd indicated, \"ok lydia, you don't bare us specific ill will\" -- can you tell me what that is?</div>\n<div>- lydia: oh, that's Anghala, she's a water elemental that I met here.</div>\n<div>- JL: what is your name?</div>\n<div>- Nuphar</div>\n<br />\n<div>- Flick: why are there so many bones down in your trench -- and I don't mean that euphemistically.</div>\n<div>nuphlar :i don't know what that would be</div>\n<div>- Lydia: they were victims to some event that preceeded me by just a few days -- it's hard to remember. I've been hear for a few months, but I remember an event, an explosion? i saw it from the hills and came here with an old man. He was the one who was a hermit and spoke of hermits!</div>\n<div>- Vengeance: was he a monk?</div>\n<div>- Lydia: well he lived above us; we all lived in the hills. (She's speaking of the Honied Hills)</div>\n<br />\n<div>Barrow Elves, really only seen in this region of the world, live here, they have a few spiritual centers. Wrentop; Hallux, and the Three Sisters . the honied hills are all populated by Barrow Elves, who have something to do with graves or tombs; there are rumors that they're alves that were once dead, or look over ancient graves from battles long forgotten. rarely show themselves to mortals or non-fey. the fact that a hermit or she is here is very unusual.</div>\n<br />\n<div>They haven't passed craters, or seen blasted areas. JL thinks about how odd it was that only recent vegetation. and thinks: was the explosion so big that it created the lake? what could cause an explosion that large?</div>\n<br />\n<div>Nuphar is still a little out of it, -- yes, the explosion: when i came here, i came down the river. the river used to -- we used to be able to go to the coast. but now it stops here. I think -- that's right.</div>\n<br />\n<div>[nature check] - vengeance knows about this; it was spoken of in the monkish apocalypse. the lake description matches the impact footprint of a meteor. if it happened about a year ago, it's conceivable that fast-growing vegetation would have grown here, especially if it intersected with the course of a river.</div>\n<br />\n<div>- Flick: so the trench could have been an udnerground warren that was -- enough ground was scooped away to reveal it. the burrowlings all died in the blast.</div>\n<div>- Lydia: I think i blocked it out. there was devastation, and so much death.</div>\n<div>- Flick: then what are those two things that we fought?</div>\n<div>- one of them died like a balloon having the air let out</div>\n<div>- Lydia: it struck again, new deaths! she's hallucinating. she thinks these creatures were dead from something else. the memory of seeing this a year ago has caused her to lose her connection.</div>\n<div>- Flick: i'm sorry for assuming the worst of you.

I only offer you understanding. And solidarity.<strong> When I was a child, I had a very controlling father. Perhaps you know what it's like being under control yourself by a tyrannical device or whatever it is that's controlling you. I want you to know that it's okay.

Hieronymus: Yes, I actually liked her. She was one of the good ones. And we had delicious frog dinners in those days. Rotrude: What else did you like about her? Hieronymus: She was cool because she didn't go around drowning and blaming me for it. That's something that I really dislike in a person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bruce\n<ul>\n<li>Rotrude, hearing 'Bruce' spoken from above, asks, \"Did someone mention Bruce?

He would cover his beloved mule with stinky mud and bring her back to the monastery to annoy everyone; like a cow, once brought up the stairs she couldn't go back down. She would remain where she was until a barn elevator was built to bring her down.&nbsp;{&sect;030}</li>\n<li>Rotrude shouts, \"You sure had your share of pathetic girlfriends in your day as well.

(which is the only song he can play). there&rsquo;s a heavily orchestrated version ; but hieronymus is playing the hot cross buns learner&rsquo;s version. he starts to play and looks over to see if Shoemaker is reacting in any way, like taking her helmet off (out of respect)&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>- He plays really terribly but realizes that no one else can hear his telepathy; it might be that tapping into the whisper walls is using all his telepathic energy, or nobody heard him (not getting service down here). but he still thinks he&rsquo;s telepathic.
